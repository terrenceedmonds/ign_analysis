Don't get me wrong, review scores are in the eye of the beholder so I'm sure there are plenty of times that you've read something I have written and not agreed with me. I mean that it's rare for me to play a game during a demo and not have a solid idea of what the final product is going to be. I played bits of Batman: Arkham Asylum a few times before I finally got a copy to review, and I always found myself coming away with mixed feelings. I enjoyed the combat and attacking from the shadows, but the pacing seemed off and Batman's movements seemed stiff. Could Rocksteady really pull everything together to deliver on one of DC Comics' biggest franchises? \\u003csection data-transform=\\\"mobile-ad-break\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e After having beaten the game, I can tell you the answer is most certainly \\\"Yes.\\\" \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e \\u003ctable width=\\\"460\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" cellspacing=\\\"0\\\" cellpadding=\\\"5\\\"\\u003e\\u003ctr bgcolor=\\\"#f1f1f3\\\"\\u003e\\u003ctd\\u003e\\u003cp class=\\\"aligncenter\\\"\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCollector's Edition Content\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e Batman: Arkham Asylum's a great game by itself, but \\u003ca class='autolink' href='https://xbox360.ign.com/objects/143/14339162.html'\\u003eBatman: Arkham Asylum (Collector's Edition)\\u003c/a\\u003e tosses in a few pieces of paraphernalia to sweeten the deal. On top of the game, you're getting a DVD with a bunch of trailers and more than 30 minutes of behind the scenes features, a 48-page book on the insane asylum's inmates, a 14-inch batarang, a case to store all this stuff, and a code to download the exclusive Crime Alley challenge map. \\u003cp\\u003e Obviously, all this sounds cool, but it's going to cost you an extra $40, which brings the grand total to a cool $100. Personally, I think that's a bit too much for what you're getting. The case is pretty ugly and won't turn heads, the book is just art and basic info you'll find in the game if you complete the Riddler's challenges, and the behind the scenes videos on the DVD are just similar features to the ones you can find \\u003ca href=\\\"https://media.ps3.ign.com/media/142/14273490/vids_1.html\\\"\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eon IGN\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e.  \\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e  \\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e The idea of having your own batarang is cool, but the actual product is less than impressive. A plastic object that's attached to a plastic stand, the batarang can't be thrown and is scratched up to simulate actual bat-use. It feels flimsy, and cheap gray stand isn't helping. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e The one standout in the pack is the Crime Alley challenge map. This is a straight fist-fighting challenge where you need to beat four waves of the Joker's men and it's set in the very alley where Bruce Wayne's parents were killed. There are no references to the murders, but this is still your only chance to play in this area. It's nifty -- and comes with the same leaderboard setup you'd expect -- but it's not worth the $40 by itself.  \\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e Although Crime Alley is a nice addition, it doesn't add a completely new gameplay experience and multiple challenges like \\u003ca href=\\\"https://ps3.ign.com/articles/101/1017156p1.html\\\"\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003ethe free Joker DLC on the PS3 did\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e.

The batarang isn't as cool as it sounds, the book won't do much for you, and the DLC doesn't justify the price. Only those truly dedicated to the Dark Knight (see: obsessed like the Joker) should bother giving this thing the once over. Still, I'm not knocking any points off of this version's score because the game itself is as solid as ever. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e \\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003c/td\\u003e\\u003c/tr\\u003e\\u003c/table\\u003e \\u003cbr /\\u003e Batman: Arkham Asylum is a third-person action game casting you as -- you guessed it, chum -- the Dark Knight himself. The title opens with Batman racing back to Arkham, Gotham's home for the criminally insane, with the Joker in tow. Seems the Clown Prince of Crime broke out a few weeks ago, but Batman was able to track him down and re-apprehend the baddie. However, things are never what they seem with the Joker, so after getting the wiry maniac back into the building -- a building stocked with hundreds of the Joker's goons after a \\\"mysterious\\\" fire at their prison -- Mr. J breaks free with the help of Harley Quinn, takes control of the penitentiary, and releases all the inmates. \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e Holy plot twist, Batman! \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e From there, you're off on an adventure that ranks right below The Dark Knight movie in terms of awesome Batman experiences. The actual Arkham campus is a loony bin spread across multiple buildings on one massive rock. With the Joker in charge you're going to have to swing over rooms filled with gas, save doctors, rip vent covers off the walls so you can make a path around locked doors, and move as fast as Batman can to stop the Joker from releasing an army of monsters on the people of Gotham City. \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e Now, that might sound like your typical Batman story -- and it kind of is -- but it's important to point out that this is a fairly adult title. Yeah, some of the folks from Batman: The Animated Series are back to reprise their roles (Mark Hamill is the Joker, Kevin Conroy is Batman, and Arleen Sorkin is Harley Quinn), but this isn't the cartoon. Harley's wearing a fairly skimpy outfit that shows off her lady parts, Poison Ivy's in some painted-on panties, colorful language like \\\"ass\\\" and \\\"bitch\\\" is peppered in, and there are people getting murdered left and right. Arkham itself is a dark and dingy place that just had every psychopath housed there run through the halls tearing the building apart. Dead guards are laid out on the floor, papers are strewn about, and the facilities have seen better days.  \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e \\u003c!-- start image div  --\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"image-with-caption\\\" data-image-url=\\\"https://ps3media.ign.com/ps3/image/article/101/1016585/batman-arkham-asylum-20090821085306211-000.jpg\\\" data-caption=\\\"What+do+you+fear?\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003c!--- end image div --\\u003eThese adult themes tied in with a very, very Batman-looking world really drive home your connection to the story. I don't think I'm ever going to forget Mr. Zsasz holding a knife to a female doctor, her screaming for me to save her, the Joker screaming at Zsasz to kill her, and Zsasz screaming at me to stay back. After years of the Riddler being goofy, I realized Arkham's version of the character was on a different level when he told a Riddle that ended in dismembering a baby. Plus, the segments where you're under the Scarecrow's influence and Batman's worst fears are realized are some of the coolest, most cerebral parts of the game. These are the moments that wrapped me up in the experience and made me feel like Batman on the longest night of his life. \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e Gameplay in this dark, creepy world breaks down into three main portions -- fist fighting, attacking from the shadows, and exploration. As you move from room to room chasing Harley or Commissioner Gordon's kidnapper, you're going to run into bad guys. Lots of times, you'll find a crew milling about or the Joker will spring a trap with handfuls of guys who are ready to kill you. This is when you'll make use of your straight hand-to-hand moves.  \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e Fist fighting in Arkham Asylum is pretty much the definition of an easy to learn/hard to master combat system. The game allows Batman to move faster than his enemies (He's a trained ninja, people!) and engage them in 360 degrees. You just point your left stick towards whatever enemy you want to attack and Batman follows suit. Through four buttons -- strike, reverse, jump, and stun -- you'll unleash Mr. Wayne's fury on the scum of the Earth. Obviously, you can just mash the strike button and take down the bad guys with a healthy set of animations -- dropkicks, elbows, punches, and more are peppered in -- and reverse when you see the spider-sense icon pop-up above a bad guy's head, but there's a sweet science to this madness. \\u003cbr /\\u003e   \\u003c/section\\u003e\",\"\\u003csection class=\\\"article-page\\\"\\u003e   \\u003cbr /\\u003e This system is great. I felt empowered as I knocked these creeps down, grabbed their bats and slammed them back into the attackers. I'm sure it sounds like the process could get repetitive, but the crooks start using tasers and knives eventually, and that leads to you having to fight them in a different way and avoid simply mashing the strike button; you need to get behind the taser-packing guys to strike and daze the knife dudes before socking them in the jaw. \\u003csection data-transform=\\\"mobile-ad-break\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e As you ping-pong off people with your savage attacks, a combo meter tallies your strikes on the left side of the screen. As long as each of your attacks is landing (Don't mash the buttons; pick your shots.) and you're not getting hit (Reverse, Master Bruce!), the combo count keeps climbing. I'm sure it sounds simple, but you'd be surprised how good you have to be to link together massive combos. If you can get the count up to eight (five with an upgrade), you can do special moves once you've unlocked them, and I can tell you that I don't do special moves all that often.  \\u003cbr /\\u003e \\u003cp class=\\\"aligncenter\\\"\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\\"https://ps3.ign.com/dor/objects/14273490/batman-arkham-asylum/videos/batmanaa_vdr_082009.html\\\"\\u003e\\u003cimg src=\\\"https://ps3media.ign.com/ps3/image/article/101/1016585/batman-arkham-asylum-20090821011624757.jpg\\\" /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eIt not what I say that defines this video review, but what I do.\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cbr /\\u003e Still, whatever your largest combo is by the end of the fight, you're going to get a bonus in terms of XP. See, there's this little circle in the upper-left corner of the screen that is your XP gauge. Pulling off moves and besting challenges fills in the gauge, and when the two ends meet, you get to pick an upgrade for either Batman's suit for more health, moves for super-cool takedowns, Batarangs for power and such, or other weapons like your explosive gel. \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e You're also going to earn XP by taking out your opponents from the shadows. While there are going to be those times where Joker's men ambush you, there are also \\\"Invisible Predator\\\" moments. This is where you get the drop on a roomful of bad guys who are patrolling. These sections are cool because they forced me to play like Batman and not some random action game character. I'd shoot up to a gargoyle, kick on detective mode to see how many enemies I was up against, and then start picking them off one by one. If there was just one dude with a gun in the group, I'd glide in to take him out and then move to the other baddies. If there was more than one gunman, I'd stick to the shadows so as not to get my brains blown against the wall. \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e There's a lot of freedom on how you want to engage these bad guys, and it's one of the best parts of the game. You could wait for a guy to be alone and then glide kick in and perform a ground takedown, but you've got access to Batman's entire utility belt if you want. Once everything's unlocked, you can use explosive gel to blow out walls and knock guys out, you can through Sonic Batarangs that'll then explode, you can pull people over railings with the grappling hook, and you smash through windows to take guys out. \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e And all of that is just for starters. There's a line launcher, grates to pop out of, and gargoyles to hang bad guys from. Still, for me, the most satisfying part of these missions are the silent takedowns. This is where you crouch, come up behind an unsuspecting grunt, and choke the guy out. There are a few animations for these moves, and they're so quiet that even a bad guy just a few feet away from the attack can't hear it. \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e \\u003c!-- start image div  --\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"image-with-caption\\\" data-image-url=\\\"https://ps3media.ign.com/ps3/image/article/101/1016585/batman-arkham-asylum-20090821011634116-000.jpg\\\" data-caption=\\\"Strike+from+the+shadows.+Be+Batman.\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003c!--- end image div --\\u003eWhile I enjoy the fact that the AI doesn't notice friends getting silently KO'd, there are plenty of times you'll plop down next to a goon or come right up on his peripheral vision and not be seen even though you would be in real life. Playing on Hard, which is available from the start, makes the AI a bit smarter, but I still could've gone for more attentive henchmen. \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e Still, Arkham excels despite any miniscule gripe I might have, and a big part of that draw is how much fun it is to explore this place. There are six main buildings on the island and each is cavernous. These places are filled with cells, laboratories, libraries, and more. Most of the interesting rooms are locked or blocked, so it's up to you to use your cryptographic sequencer to hack security panels or the gel to knock down walls and crawl through grates to get where you're going.  \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e The driving motivation behind these quests will be the 240 Riddler challenges in the game. Every so often, the man in green chirps a riddle into Batman's earpiece that pertains to the room the Caped Crusader is in, and it'll be up to you to locate the answer and scan it with your analysis tool. Beyond those word problems, the Riddler's challenges include trophies he's tucked away in the asylum, visual puzzles you can only solve through Detective Mode, and more. It took me about nine hours to finish this game on the normal difficulty, but once I was done, I doubled back and spent another two or three hours polishing off Edward Nigma's challenges -- it was pretty awesome to walk around the empty buildings (there's no aftermath to play through so a completed save just picks up right before the final battle) and get to take in every poster, prop, and sight gag Rocksteady included as a nod to the comics. \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e Without spoiling anything, finding Ra's al Ghul is pretty cool. \\u003cbr /\\u003e   \\u003c/section\\u003e\",\"\\u003csection class=\\\"article-page\\\"\\u003e   \\u003cbr /\\u003e One of the things you'll be collecting as you go off on the Riddler's challenge is patient interviews. These are five-part audio logs for each of the main villains in the game. Each one of these is a mini-story showing you how sick these people are as they converse with the Arkham staff -- Poison Ivy almost kills her doctor, Croc talks about eating people, and the Joker turns Harley to the darkside. Each of them is riveting and really gives you a well-rounded look at who the Scarecrow is and why the Riddler is so crazy. These are stored in the character bio section for each main villain. Even though most don't have audio logs, there are 42 bios to unlock. \\u003csection data-transform=\\\"mobile-ad-break\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e \\u003cp class=\\\"aligncenter\\\"\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\\"https://ps3.ign.com/dor/objects/14273490/batman-arkham-asylum/videos/batman_gmp_thatsmyharley_8509.html\\\"\\u003e\\u003cimg src=\\\"https://ps3media.ign.com/ps3/image/article/101/1016585/batman-arkham-asylum-20090821011625304.jpg\\\" /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eVa-va-va-voom.\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cbr /\\u003e As if all this story mode content wasn't enough to keep you wrapped up in your Robin PJs, Arkham Asylum also tosses in 16 challenge rooms for you to go nuts in. Again, these are broken up between 360-degree fighting and the Invisible Predator challenges, but there's more pressure thanks to the three medals for every event and the online leaderboards. For the straight fighting ones, you'll need to pull off certain scores to come away with one, two, or three medals. Getting the highest honor of three awards means that you're chaining together insane combos and decimating anyone who gets in your way. Eventually, you'll only have a certain amount of time to finish these fights. Meanwhile, in the Invisible Predator rounds, you'll get medals for pulling off certain feats such as zip-lining into an enemy and knocking him over a railing as well as blowing up three different walls while taking out three different enemies at the same time.  \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e Personally, I wasn't sold when I first heard about these challenges -- I mean, they're in the same environments as the fights in the story, so it's kind of like you're just replaying certain levels again. However, once I started chasing scores on the leaderboards (which are displayed when you're browsing through the different challenges) and hunting the Trophy/Achievement for the 40-hit combo, I could see how great these sections were to just drop in and fight. Again, it's a blast to be Batman and take out crooks with flipping punches and well-timed Batarangs, so it's only more fun to do it as fast as possible and beat your buddy's score. \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e I've touched on how well-done and important characterization is in this game, but I do need to take a second and tell you how good the voice acting and sound is as well. There were plenty of times I'd find myself just sitting in an air duct listening to the Joker yammer over the loudspeaker. Mark Hamill is excellent in this game -- his inflection, his timing, and everything else is just spot-on. Thing is, he's not the exception to the rule -- Batman, Poison Ivy, the Riddler all sound excellent. Sure, some of the guards are hit or miss, but the characters you care about nail it. Add in the fact that you have an orchestral score that fits the dark, brooding mood of the game, and you have a title that is everything a Batman game's supposed to be in terms of mood. \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e \\u003c!-- start image div  --\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"image-with-caption\\\" data-image-url=\\\"https://ps3media.ign.com/ps3/image/article/101/1016585/batman-arkham-asylum-20090821011633601-000.jpg\\\" data-caption=\\\"How+would+you+beat+him?\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003c!--- end image div --\\u003eIn terms of visual fidelity, Batman: Arkham Asylum looks great. The island is that right creepy/cool mix, and the fact that Batman's face and suit takes damage as the story progresses drives home how bad this night has been. Still, there is some screen tearing during the opening movie, CGI stuff has a tendency to get some pixelization, and the in-game cutscenes have guards with bug-eyes and shoddy lip syncing. None of those are giant issues, but they're there and it can hurt the presentation to see Joker wiggling his head around while talking to Batman but clearly never be looking at Batman.  \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e If you want to start a flame war, the graphics tend to be sharper on the Xbox 360 when compared to the PS3, which packs a 1.2 GB install that lasts for three minutes. Still, it's not enough to matter in terms of how great this game truly is so don't expect a score difference in terms of reviews. Of course, the PS3 also has the exclusive ability to take on challenges as the Joker, but I'm not including that in this review because the Joker stuff isn't on the game disc -- it's free DLC you get from the PlayStation Store.\\u003c/section\\u003e\"],\"authorSocialDetails\":[{\"nickname\":null,\"name\":\"Greg Miller\",\"thumbnailUrl\":null,\"__typename\":\"Author\"}],\"__typename\":\"Article\",\"subHeadline\":\"Behold the greatest comic book game of all time.\",\"headerImageUrl\":null,\"showCommerceDisclaimer\":false,\"breadcrumbs\":[{\"id\":\"a03cfae3-3b17-4a4f-a389-53b142e00554\",\"url\":\"/games/batman-arkham-asylum\",\"slug\":\"batman-arkham-asylum\",\"metadata\":{\"names\":{\"name\":\"Batman: Arkham Asylum\",\"alt\":[],\"short\":null,\"__typename\":\"Names\"},\"__typename\":\"Metadata\"},\"objectRegions\":[{\"name\":\"Batman: Arkham Asylum\",\"shortName\":null,\"region\":\"US\",\"__typename\":\"ObjectRegion\"}],\"__typename\":\"Object\"}],\"review\":{\"blurb\":null,\"comment\":\"Batman: Arkham Asylum is the greatest comic book videogame of all time.

On top of the game, you're getting a DVD with a bunch of trailers and more than 30 minutes of behind the scenes features, a 48-page book on the insane asylum's inmates, a 14-inch batarang, a case to store all this stuff, and a code to download the exclusive Crime Alley challenge map. \\u003cp\\u003e Obviously, all this sounds cool, but it's going to cost you an extra $40, which brings the grand total to a cool $100. Personally, I think that's a bit too much for what you're getting. The case is pretty ugly and won't turn heads, the book is just art and basic info you'll find in the game if you complete the Riddler's challenges, and the behind the scenes videos on the DVD are just similar features to the ones you can find \\u003ca href=\\\"https://media.ps3.ign.com/media/142/14273490/vids_1.html\\\"\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eon IGN\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e.  \\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e  \\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e The idea of having your own batarang is cool, but the actual product is less than impressive. A plastic object that's attached to a plastic stand, the batarang can't be thrown and is scratched up to simulate actual bat-use. It feels flimsy, and cheap gray stand isn't helping. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e The one standout in the pack is the Crime Alley challenge map. This is a straight fist-fighting challenge where you need to beat four waves of the Joker's men and it's set in the very alley where Bruce Wayne's parents were killed. There are no references to the murders, but this is still your only chance to play in this area. It's nifty -- and comes with the same leaderboard setup you'd expect -- but it's not worth the $40 by itself.  \\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e Although Crime Alley is a nice addition, it doesn't add a completely new gameplay experience and multiple challenges like \\u003ca href=\\\"https://ps3.ign.com/articles/101/1017156p1.html\\\"\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003ethe free Joker DLC on the PS3 did\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e.

The batarang isn't as cool as it sounds, the book won't do much for you, and the DLC doesn't justify the price. Only those truly dedicated to the Dark Knight (see: obsessed like the Joker) should bother giving this thing the once over. Still, I'm not knocking any points off of this version's score because the game itself is as solid as ever. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e \\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003c/td\\u003e\\u003c/tr\\u003e\\u003c/table\\u003e \\u003cbr /\\u003e Batman: Arkham Asylum is a third-person action game casting you as -- you guessed it, chum -- the Dark Knight himself. The title opens with Batman racing back to Arkham, Gotham's home for the criminally insane, with the Joker in tow. Seems the Clown Prince of Crime broke out a few weeks ago, but Batman was able to track him down and re-apprehend the baddie. However, things are never what they seem with the Joker, so after getting the wiry maniac back into the building -- a building stocked with hundreds of the Joker's goons after a \\\"mysterious\\\" fire at their prison -- Mr. J breaks free with the help of Harley Quinn, takes control of the penitentiary, and releases all the inmates. \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e Holy plot twist, Batman! \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e From there, you're off on an adventure that ranks right below The Dark Knight movie in terms of awesome Batman experiences. The actual Arkham campus is a loony bin spread across multiple buildings on one massive rock. With the Joker in charge you're going to have to swing over rooms filled with gas, save doctors, rip vent covers off the walls so you can make a path around locked doors, and move as fast as Batman can to stop the Joker from releasing an army of monsters on the people of Gotham City. \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e Now, that might sound like your typical Batman story -- and it kind of is -- but it's important to point out that this is a fairly adult title. Yeah, some of the folks from Batman: The Animated Series are back to reprise their roles (Mark Hamill is the Joker, Kevin Conroy is Batman, and Arleen Sorkin is Harley Quinn), but this isn't the cartoon. Harley's wearing a fairly skimpy outfit that shows off her lady parts, Poison Ivy's in some painted-on panties, colorful language like \\\"ass\\\" and \\\"bitch\\\" is peppered in, and there are people getting murdered left and right. Arkham itself is a dark and dingy place that just had every psychopath housed there run through the halls tearing the building apart. Dead guards are laid out on the floor, papers are strewn about, and the facilities have seen better days.  \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e \\u003c!-- start image div  --\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"image-with-caption\\\" data-image-url=\\\"https://ps3media.ign.com/ps3/image/article/101/1016585/batman-arkham-asylum-20090821085306211-000.jpg\\\" data-caption=\\\"What+do+you+fear?\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003c!--- end image div --\\u003eThese adult themes tied in with a very, very Batman-looking world really drive home your connection to the story. I don't think I'm ever going to forget Mr. Zsasz holding a knife to a female doctor, her screaming for me to save her, the Joker screaming at Zsasz to kill her, and Zsasz screaming at me to stay back. After years of the Riddler being goofy, I realized Arkham's version of the character was on a different level when he told a Riddle that ended in dismembering a baby. Plus, the segments where you're under the Scarecrow's influence and Batman's worst fears are realized are some of the coolest, most cerebral parts of the game. These are the moments that wrapped me up in the experience and made me feel like Batman on the longest night of his life. \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e Gameplay in this dark, creepy world breaks down into three main portions -- fist fighting, attacking from the shadows, and exploration. As you move from room to room chasing Harley or Commissioner Gordon's kidnapper, you're going to run into bad guys. Lots of times, you'll find a crew milling about or the Joker will spring a trap with handfuls of guys who are ready to kill you. This is when you'll make use of your straight hand-to-hand moves.  \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e Fist fighting in Arkham Asylum is pretty much the definition of an easy to learn/hard to master combat system. The game allows Batman to move faster than his enemies (He's a trained ninja, people!) and engage them in 360 degrees. You just point your left stick towards whatever enemy you want to attack and Batman follows suit. Through four buttons -- strike, reverse, jump, and stun -- you'll unleash Mr. Wayne's fury on the scum of the Earth. Obviously, you can just mash the strike button and take down the bad guys with a healthy set of animations -- dropkicks, elbows, punches, and more are peppered in -- and reverse when you see the spider-sense icon pop-up above a bad guy's head, but there's a sweet science to this madness. \\u003cbr /\\u003e   \\u003c/section\\u003e\",\"\\u003csection class=\\\"article-page\\\"\\u003e   \\u003cbr /\\u003e This system is great. I felt empowered as I knocked these creeps down, grabbed their bats and slammed them back into the attackers. I'm sure it sounds like the process could get repetitive, but the crooks start using tasers and knives eventually, and that leads to you having to fight them in a different way and avoid simply mashing the strike button; you need to get behind the taser-packing guys to strike and daze the knife dudes before socking them in the jaw. \\u003csection data-transform=\\\"mobile-ad-break\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e As you ping-pong off people with your savage attacks, a combo meter tallies your strikes on the left side of the screen. As long as each of your attacks is landing (Don't mash the buttons; pick your shots.) and you're not getting hit (Reverse, Master Bruce!), the combo count keeps climbing. I'm sure it sounds simple, but you'd be surprised how good you have to be to link together massive combos. If you can get the count up to eight (five with an upgrade), you can do special moves once you've unlocked them, and I can tell you that I don't do special moves all that often.  \\u003cbr /\\u003e \\u003cp class=\\\"aligncenter\\\"\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\\"https://ps3.ign.com/dor/objects/14273490/batman-arkham-asylum/videos/batmanaa_vdr_082009.html\\\"\\u003e\\u003cimg src=\\\"https://ps3media.ign.com/ps3/image/article/101/1016585/batman-arkham-asylum-20090821011624757.jpg\\\" /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eIt not what I say that defines this video review, but what I do.\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cbr /\\u003e Still, whatever your largest combo is by the end of the fight, you're going to get a bonus in terms of XP. See, there's this little circle in the upper-left corner of the screen that is your XP gauge. Pulling off moves and besting challenges fills in the gauge, and when the two ends meet, you get to pick an upgrade for either Batman's suit for more health, moves for super-cool takedowns, Batarangs for power and such, or other weapons like your explosive gel. \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e You're also going to earn XP by taking out your opponents from the shadows. While there are going to be those times where Joker's men ambush you, there are also \\\"Invisible Predator\\\" moments. This is where you get the drop on a roomful of bad guys who are patrolling. These sections are cool because they forced me to play like Batman and not some random action game character. I'd shoot up to a gargoyle, kick on detective mode to see how many enemies I was up against, and then start picking them off one by one. If there was just one dude with a gun in the group, I'd glide in to take him out and then move to the other baddies. If there was more than one gunman, I'd stick to the shadows so as not to get my brains blown against the wall. \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e There's a lot of freedom on how you want to engage these bad guys, and it's one of the best parts of the game. You could wait for a guy to be alone and then glide kick in and perform a ground takedown, but you've got access to Batman's entire utility belt if you want. Once everything's unlocked, you can use explosive gel to blow out walls and knock guys out, you can through Sonic Batarangs that'll then explode, you can pull people over railings with the grappling hook, and you smash through windows to take guys out. \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e And all of that is just for starters. There's a line launcher, grates to pop out of, and gargoyles to hang bad guys from. Still, for me, the most satisfying part of these missions are the silent takedowns. This is where you crouch, come up behind an unsuspecting grunt, and choke the guy out. There are a few animations for these moves, and they're so quiet that even a bad guy just a few feet away from the attack can't hear it. \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e \\u003c!-- start image div  --\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"image-with-caption\\\" data-image-url=\\\"https://ps3media.ign.com/ps3/image/article/101/1016585/batman-arkham-asylum-20090821011634116-000.jpg\\\" data-caption=\\\"Strike+from+the+shadows.+Be+Batman.\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003c!--- end image div --\\u003eWhile I enjoy the fact that the AI doesn't notice friends getting silently KO'd, there are plenty of times you'll plop down next to a goon or come right up on his peripheral vision and not be seen even though you would be in real life. Playing on Hard, which is available from the start, makes the AI a bit smarter, but I still could've gone for more attentive henchmen. \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e Still, Arkham excels despite any miniscule gripe I might have, and a big part of that draw is how much fun it is to explore this place. There are six main buildings on the island and each is cavernous. These places are filled with cells, laboratories, libraries, and more. Most of the interesting rooms are locked or blocked, so it's up to you to use your cryptographic sequencer to hack security panels or the gel to knock down walls and crawl through grates to get where you're going.  \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e The driving motivation behind these quests will be the 240 Riddler challenges in the game. Every so often, the man in green chirps a riddle into Batman's earpiece that pertains to the room the Caped Crusader is in, and it'll be up to you to locate the answer and scan it with your analysis tool. Beyond those word problems, the Riddler's challenges include trophies he's tucked away in the asylum, visual puzzles you can only solve through Detective Mode, and more. It took me about nine hours to finish this game on the normal difficulty, but once I was done, I doubled back and spent another two or three hours polishing off Edward Nigma's challenges -- it was pretty awesome to walk around the empty buildings (there's no aftermath to play through so a completed save just picks up right before the final battle) and get to take in every poster, prop, and sight gag Rocksteady included as a nod to the comics. \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e Without spoiling anything, finding Ra's al Ghul is pretty cool. \\u003cbr /\\u003e   \\u003c/section\\u003e\",\"\\u003csection class=\\\"article-page\\\"\\u003e   \\u003cbr /\\u003e One of the things you'll be collecting as you go off on the Riddler's challenge is patient interviews. These are five-part audio logs for each of the main villains in the game. Each one of these is a mini-story showing you how sick these people are as they converse with the Arkham staff -- Poison Ivy almost kills her doctor, Croc talks about eating people, and the Joker turns Harley to the darkside. Each of them is riveting and really gives you a well-rounded look at who the Scarecrow is and why the Riddler is so crazy. These are stored in the character bio section for each main villain. Even though most don't have audio logs, there are 42 bios to unlock. \\u003csection data-transform=\\\"mobile-ad-break\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e \\u003cp class=\\\"aligncenter\\\"\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\\"https://ps3.ign.com/dor/objects/14273490/batman-arkham-asylum/videos/batman_gmp_thatsmyharley_8509.html\\\"\\u003e\\u003cimg src=\\\"https://ps3media.ign.com/ps3/image/article/101/1016585/batman-arkham-asylum-20090821011625304.jpg\\\" /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eVa-va-va-voom.\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cbr /\\u003e As if all this story mode content wasn't enough to keep you wrapped up in your Robin PJs, Arkham Asylum also tosses in 16 challenge rooms for you to go nuts in. Again, these are broken up between 360-degree fighting and the Invisible Predator challenges, but there's more pressure thanks to the three medals for every event and the online leaderboards. For the straight fighting ones, you'll need to pull off certain scores to come away with one, two, or three medals. Getting the highest honor of three awards means that you're chaining together insane combos and decimating anyone who gets in your way. Eventually, you'll only have a certain amount of time to finish these fights. Meanwhile, in the Invisible Predator rounds, you'll get medals for pulling off certain feats such as zip-lining into an enemy and knocking him over a railing as well as blowing up three different walls while taking out three different enemies at the same time.  \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e Personally, I wasn't sold when I first heard about these challenges -- I mean, they're in the same environments as the fights in the story, so it's kind of like you're just replaying certain levels again. However, once I started chasing scores on the leaderboards (which are displayed when you're browsing through the different challenges) and hunting the Trophy/Achievement for the 40-hit combo, I could see how great these sections were to just drop in and fight. Again, it's a blast to be Batman and take out crooks with flipping punches and well-timed Batarangs, so it's only more fun to do it as fast as possible and beat your buddy's score. \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e I've touched on how well-done and important characterization is in this game, but I do need to take a second and tell you how good the voice acting and sound is as well. There were plenty of times I'd find myself just sitting in an air duct listening to the Joker yammer over the loudspeaker. Mark Hamill is excellent in this game -- his inflection, his timing, and everything else is just spot-on. Thing is, he's not the exception to the rule -- Batman, Poison Ivy, the Riddler all sound excellent. Sure, some of the guards are hit or miss, but the characters you care about nail it. Add in the fact that you have an orchestral score that fits the dark, brooding mood of the game, and you have a title that is everything a Batman game's supposed to be in terms of mood. \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e \\u003c!-- start image div  --\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"image-with-caption\\\" data-image-url=\\\"https://ps3media.ign.com/ps3/image/article/101/1016585/batman-arkham-asylum-20090821011633601-000.jpg\\\" data-caption=\\\"How+would+you+beat+him?\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003c!--- end image div --\\u003eIn terms of visual fidelity, Batman: Arkham Asylum looks great. The island is that right creepy/cool mix, and the fact that Batman's face and suit takes damage as the story progresses drives home how bad this night has been. Still, there is some screen tearing during the opening movie, CGI stuff has a tendency to get some pixelization, and the in-game cutscenes have guards with bug-eyes and shoddy lip syncing. None of those are giant issues, but they're there and it can hurt the presentation to see Joker wiggling his head around while talking to Batman but clearly never be looking at Batman.  \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e If you want to start a flame war, the graphics tend to be sharper on the Xbox 360 when compared to the PS3, which packs a 1.2 GB install that lasts for three minutes. Still, it's not enough to matter in terms of how great this game truly is so don't expect a score difference in terms of reviews. Of course, the PS3 also has the exclusive ability to take on challenges as the Joker, but I'm not including that in this review because the Joker stuff isn't on the game disc -- it's free DLC you get from the PlayStation Store.\\u003c/section\\u003e\"]},\"authorSocialDetails\":[{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":true,\"id\":\"Article:4faba26e9e4e5021868ba6bb.authorSocialDetails.0\",\"typename\":\"Author\"}],\"object\":{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":false,\"id\":\"Object:a03cfae3-3b17-4a4f-a389-53b142e00554\",\"typename\":\"Object\"},\"__typename\":\"Article\",\"subHeadline\":\"Behold the greatest comic book game of all time.\",\"headerImageUrl\":null,\"showCommerceDisclaimer\":false,\"breadcrumbs\":[{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":false,\"id\":\"Object:a03cfae3-3b17-4a4f-a389-53b142e00554\",\"typename\":\"Object\"}],\"review\":{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":true,\"id\":\"$Article:4faba26e9e4e5021868ba6bb.review\",\"typename\":\"Review\"},\"abTests\":[],\"hrefLangs\":{\"type\":\"json\",\"json\":{}}},\"Article:4faba26e9e4e5021868ba6bb.authorSocialDetails.0\":{\"nickname\":null,\"name\":\"Greg Miller\",\"thumbnailUrl\":null,\"__typename\":\"Author\"},\"Object:a03cfae3-3b17-4a4f-a389-53b142e00554\":{\"id\":\"a03cfae3-3b17-4a4f-a389-53b142e00554\",\"parentId\":null,\"type\":\"Game\",\"enabled\":true,\"canceled\":false,\"slug\":\"batman-arkham-asylum\",\"url\":\"/games/batman-arkham-asylum\",\"psNow\":true,\"primaryReview\":{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":false,\"id\":\"Review:287615\",\"typename\":\"Review\"},\"metadata\":{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":true,\"id\":\"$Object:a03cfae3-3b17-4a4f-a389-53b142e00554.metadata\",\"typename\":\"Metadata\"},\"features\":[{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":true,\"id\":\"Object:a03cfae3-3b17-4a4f-a389-53b142e00554.features.0\",\"typename\":\"Attribute\"}],\"franchises\":[],\"genres\":[{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":true,\"id\":\"Object:a03cfae3-3b17-4a4f-a389-53b142e00554.genres.0\",\"typename\":\"Attribute\"}],\"producers\":[{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":true,\"id\":\"Object:a03cfae3-3b17-4a4f-a389-53b142e00554.producers.0\",\"typename\":\"Attribute\"}],\"publishers\":[{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":true,\"id\":\"Object:a03cfae3-3b17-4a4f-a389-53b142e00554.publishers.0\",\"typename\":\"Attribute\"},{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":true,\"id\":\"Object:a03cfae3-3b17-4a4f-a389-53b142e00554.publishers.1\",\"typename\":\"Attribute\"},{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":true,\"id\":\"Object:a03cfae3-3b17-4a4f-a389-53b142e00554.publishers.2\",\"typename\":\"Attribute\"}],\"primaryImage\":{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":true,\"id\":\"$Object:a03cfae3-3b17-4a4f-a389-53b142e00554.primaryImage\",\"typename\":\"Image\"},\"commerce({\\\"region\\\":\\\"us\\\"})\":{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":true,\"id\":\"$Object:a03cfae3-3b17-4a4f-a389-53b142e00554.commerce({\\\"region\\\":\\\"us\\\"})\",\"typename\":\"Commerce\"},\"objectRegions({\\\"enabled\\\":true,\\\"region\\\":\\\"us\\\"})\":[{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":false,\"id\":\"ObjectRegion:1444929\",\"typename\":\"ObjectRegion\"}],\"__typename\":\"Object\",\"objectRegions({\\\"region\\\":\\\"us\\\"})\":[{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":true,\"id\":\"Object:a03cfae3-3b17-4a4f-a389-53b142e00554.objectRegions({\\\"region\\\":\\\"us\\\"}).0\",\"typename\":\"ObjectRegion\"}]},\"Review:287615\":{\"score\":9.3,\"editorsChoice\":true,\"articleUrl\":\"https://pc.ign.com/articles/102/1023739p1.html\",\"videoUrl\":\"https://www.ign.com/videos/2009/08/26/batman-arkham-asylum-video-review-batman-arkham-asylum-video-review?objectid=14273635\",\"__typename\":\"Review\",\"id\":\"287615\",\"scoreText\":\"amazing\",\"enabled\":true},\"$Object:a03cfae3-3b17-4a4f-a389-53b142e00554.metadata\":{\"state\":\"Published\",\"descriptions\":{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":true,\"id\":\"$Object:a03cfae3-3b17-4a4f-a389-53b142e00554.metadata.descriptions\",\"typename\":\"Description\"},\"names\":{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":true,\"id\":\"$Object:a03cfae3-3b17-4a4f-a389-53b142e00554.metadata.names\",\"typename\":\"Names\"},\"__typename\":\"Metadata\"},\"$Object:a03cfae3-3b17-4a4f-a389-53b142e00554.metadata.descriptions\":{\"long\":\"In Batman: Arkham Asylum the player assumes the role of Batman as he delivers The Joker to Arkham Asylum.

      "It's not often that I'm conflicted about a game. Don't get me wrong, review scores are in the eye of the beholder so I'm sure there are plenty of times that you've read something I have written and not agreed with me. I mean that it's rare for me to play a game during a demo and not have a solid idea of what the final product is going to be. I played bits of Batman: Arkham Asylum a few times before I finally got a copy to review, and I always found myself coming away with mixed feelings. I enjoyed the combat and attacking from the shadows, but the pacing seemed off and Batman's movements seemed stiff. Could Rocksteady really pull everything together to deliver on one of DC Comics' biggest franchises?  \\\"mobile-ad-break\\\"   After having beaten the game, I can tell you the answer is most certainly \\\"Yes.\\\"    \\u003c\\\"460\\\" border\\\"1\\\" \\\"0\\\" \\\"5\\\"\\u003ctr bgcolor\\\"#f1f1f3\\\"\\u003ctd class\\\"aligncenter\\\"Collector's Edition Content Batman: Arkham Asylum's a great game by itself, but \\u003ca class'autolink' href'https://xbox360.ign.com/objects/143/14339162.html'Batman: Arkham Asylum (Collector's Edition)\\u003c/a tosses in a few pieces of paraphernalia to sweeten the deal. On top of the game, you're getting a DVD with a bunch of trailers and more than 30 minutes of behind the scenes features, a 48-page book on the insane asylum's inmates, a 14-inch batarang, a case to store all this stuff, and a code to download the exclusive Crime Alley challenge map.  Obviously, all this sounds cool, but it's going to cost you an extra $40, which brings the grand total to a cool $100. Personally, I think that's a bit too much for what you're getting. The case is pretty ugly and won't turn heads, the book is just art and basic info you'll find in the game if you complete the Riddler's challenges, and the behind the scenes videos on the DVD are just similar features to the ones you can find \\u003ca href\\\"https://media.ps3.ign.com/media/142/14273490/vids_1.html\\\"on IGN\\u003c/a.     The idea of having your own batarang is cool, but the actual product is less than impressive. A plastic object that's attached to a plastic stand, the batarang can't be thrown and is scratched up to simulate actual bat-use. It feels flimsy, and cheap gray stand isn't helping.  The one standout in the pack is the Crime Alley challenge map. This is a straight fist-fighting challenge where you need to beat four waves of the Joker's men and it's set in the very alley where Bruce Wayne's parents were killed. There are no references to the murders, but this is still your only chance to play in this area. It's nifty -- and comes with the same leaderboard setup you'd expect -- but it's not worth the $40 by itself.   Although Crime Alley is a nice addition, it doesn't add a completely new gameplay experience and multiple challenges like \\u003ca href\\\"https://ps3.ign.com/articles/101/1017156p1.html\\\"the free Joker DLC on the PS3 did\\u003c/a. This is just one map with the same enemies and moves you've seen in the other challenges.    If you're a giant Batfan, you probably won't listen to me, but I don't see the point to nabbing this collector's edition over the standard, $40 cheaper edition. The batarang isn't as cool as it sounds, the book won't do much for you, and the DLC doesn't justify the price. Only those truly dedicated to the Dark Knight (see: obsessed like the Joker) should bother giving this thing the once over. Still, I'm not knocking any points off of this version's score because the game itself is as solid as ever.  \\u003c/td\\u003c/tr\\u003c/table  Batman: Arkham Asylum is a third-person action game casting you as -- you guessed it, chum -- the Dark Knight himself. The title opens with Batman racing back to Arkham, Gotham's home for the criminally insane, with the Joker in tow. Seems the Clown Prince of Crime broke out a few weeks ago, but Batman was able to track him down and re-apprehend the baddie. However, things are never what they seem with the Joker, so after getting the wiry maniac back into the building -- a building stocked with hundreds of the Joker's goons after a \\\"mysterious\\\" fire at their prison -- Mr. J breaks free with the help of Harley Quinn, takes control of the penitentiary, and releases all the inmates.    Holy plot twist, Batman!    From there, you're off on an adventure that ranks right below The Dark Knight movie in terms of awesome Batman experiences. The actual Arkham campus is a loony bin spread across multiple buildings on one massive rock. With the Joker in charge you're going to have to swing over rooms filled with gas, save doctors, rip vent covers off the walls so you can make a path around locked doors, and move as fast as Batman can to stop the Joker from releasing an army of monsters on the people of Gotham City.    Now, that might sound like your typical Batman story -- and it kind of is -- but it's important to point out that this is a fairly adult title. Yeah, some of the folks from Batman: The Animated Series are back to reprise their roles (Mark Hamill is the Joker, Kevin Conroy is Batman, and Arleen Sorkin is Harley Quinn), but this isn't the cartoon. Harley's wearing a fairly skimpy outfit that shows off her lady parts, Poison Ivy's in some painted-on panties, colorful language like \\\"ass\\\" and \\\"bitch\\\" is peppered in, and there are people getting murdered left and right. Arkham itself is a dark and dingy place that just had every psychopath housed there run through the halls tearing the building apart. Dead guards are laid out on the floor, papers are strewn about, and the facilities have seen better days.     \\u003c!--  --These adult themes tied in with a very, very Batman-looking world really drive home your connection to the story. I don't think I'm ever going to forget Mr. Zsasz holding a knife to a female doctor, her screaming for me to save her, the Joker screaming at Zsasz to kill her, and Zsasz screaming at me to stay back. After years of the Riddler being goofy, I realized Arkham's version of the character was on a different level when he told a Riddle that ended in dismembering a baby. Plus, the segments where you're under the Scarecrow's influence and Batman's worst fears are realized are some of the coolest, most cerebral parts of the game. These are the moments that wrapped me up in the experience and made me feel like Batman on the longest night of his life.    Gameplay in this dark, creepy world breaks down into three main portions -- fist fighting, attacking from the shadows, and exploration. As you move from room to room chasing Harley or Commissioner Gordon's kidnapper, you're going to run into bad guys. Lots of times, you'll find a crew milling about or the Joker will spring a trap with handfuls of guys who are ready to kill you. This is when you'll make use of your straight hand-to-hand moves.     Fist fighting in Arkham Asylum is pretty much the definition of an easy to learn/hard to master combat system. The game allows Batman to move faster than his enemies (He's a trained ninja, people!) and engage them in 360 degrees. You just point your left stick towards whatever enemy you want to attack and Batman follows suit. Through four buttons -- strike, reverse, jump, and stun -- you'll unleash Mr. Wayne's fury on the scum of the Earth. Obviously, you can just mash the strike button and take down the bad guys with a healthy set of animations -- dropkicks, elbows, punches, and more are peppered in -- and reverse when you see the spider-sense icon pop-up above a bad guy's head, but there's a sweet science to this madness.    \",\" class\\\"article-page\\\"    This system is great. I felt empowered as I knocked these creeps down, grabbed their bats and slammed them back into the attackers. I'm sure it sounds like the process could get repetitive, but the crooks start using tasers and knives eventually, and that leads to you having to fight them in a different way and avoid simply mashing the strike button; you need to get behind the taser-packing guys to strike and daze the knife dudes before socking them in the jaw.  \\\"mobile-ad-break\\\"   As you ping-pong off people with your savage attacks, a combo meter tallies your strikes on the left side of the screen. As long as each of your attacks is landing (Don't mash the buttons; pick your shots.) and you're not getting hit (Reverse, Master Bruce!), the combo count keeps climbing. I'm sure it sounds simple, but you'd be surprised how good you have to be to link together massive combos. If you can get the count up to eight (five with an upgrade), you can do special moves once you've unlocked them, and I can tell you that I don't do special moves all that often.    class\\\"aligncenter\\\"\\u003ca href\\\"https://ps3.ign.com/dor/objects/14273490/batman-arkham-asylum/videos/batmanaa_vdr_082009.html\\\"\\u003cimg src\\\"https://ps3media.ign.com/ps3/image/article/101/1016585/batman-arkham-asylum-20090821011624757.jpg\\\" /It not what I say that defines this video review, but what I do.\\u003c/a  Still, whatever your largest combo is by the end of the fight, you're going to get a bonus in terms of XP. See, there's this little circle in the upper-left corner of the screen that is your XP gauge. Pulling off moves and besting challenges fills in the gauge, and when the two ends meet, you get to pick an upgrade for either Batman's suit for more health, moves for super-cool takedowns, Batarangs for power and such, or other weapons like your explosive gel.    You're also going to earn XP by taking out your opponents from the shadows. While there are going to be those times where Joker's men ambush you, there are also \\\"Invisible Predator\\\" moments. This is where you get the drop on a roomful of bad guys who are patrolling. These sections are cool because they forced me to play like Batman and not some random action game character. I'd shoot up to a gargoyle, kick on detective mode to see how many enemies I was up against, and then start picking them off one by one. If there was just one dude with a gun in the group, I'd glide in to take him out and then move to the other baddies. If there was more than one gunman, I'd stick to the shadows so as not to get my brains blown against the wall.    There's a lot of freedom on how you want to engage these bad guys, and it's one of the best parts of the game. You could wait for a guy to be alone and then glide kick in and perform a ground takedown, but you've got access to Batman's entire utility belt if you want. Once everything's unlocked, you can use explosive gel to blow out walls and knock guys out, you can through Sonic Batarangs that'll then explode, you can pull people over railings with the grappling hook, and you smash through windows to take guys out.    And all of that is just for starters. There's a line launcher, grates to pop out of, and gargoyles to hang bad guys from. Still, for me, the most satisfying part of these missions are the silent takedowns. This is where you crouch, come up behind an unsuspecting grunt, and choke the guy out. There are a few animations for these moves, and they're so quiet that even a bad guy just a few feet away from the attack can't hear it.    \\u003c!--  --While I enjoy the fact that the AI doesn't notice friends getting silently KO'd, there are plenty of times you'll plop down next to a goon or come right up on his peripheral vision and not be seen even though you would be in real life. Playing on Hard, which is available from the start, makes the AI a bit smarter, but I still could've gone for more attentive henchmen.    Still, Arkham excels despite any miniscule gripe I might have, and a big part of that draw is how much fun it is to explore this place. There are six main buildings on the island and each is cavernous. These places are filled with cells, laboratories, libraries, and more. Most of the interesting rooms are locked or blocked, so it's up to you to use your cryptographic sequencer to hack security panels or the gel to knock down walls and crawl through grates to get where you're going.     The driving motivation behind these quests will be the 240 Riddler challenges in the game. Every so often, the man in green chirps a riddle into Batman's earpiece that pertains to the room the Caped Crusader is in, and it'll be up to you to locate the answer and scan it with your analysis tool. Beyond those word problems, the Riddler's challenges include trophies he's tucked away in the asylum, visual puzzles you can only solve through Detective Mode, and more. It took me about nine hours to finish this game on the normal difficulty, but once I was done, I doubled back and spent another two or three hours polishing off Edward Nigma's challenges -- it was pretty awesome to walk around the empty buildings (there's no aftermath to play through so a completed save just picks up right before the final battle) and get to take in every poster, prop, and sight gag Rocksteady included as a nod to the comics.    Without spoiling anything, finding Ra's al Ghul is pretty cool.    \",\" class\\\"article-page\\\"    One of the things you'll be collecting as you go off on the Riddler's challenge is patient interviews. These are five-part audio logs for each of the main villains in the game. Each one of these is a mini-story showing you how sick these people are as they converse with the Arkham staff -- Poison Ivy almost kills her doctor, Croc talks about eating people, and the Joker turns Harley to the darkside. Each of them is riveting and really gives you a well-rounded look at who the Scarecrow is and why the Riddler is so crazy. These are stored in the character bio section for each main villain. Even though most don't have audio logs, there are 42 bios to unlock.  \\\"mobile-ad-break\\\"  class\\\"aligncenter\\\"\\u003ca href\\\"https://ps3.ign.com/dor/objects/14273490/batman-arkham-asylum/videos/batman_gmp_thatsmyharley_8509.html\\\"\\u003cimg src\\\"https://ps3media.ign.com/ps3/image/article/101/1016585/batman-arkham-asylum-20090821011625304.jpg\\\" /Va-va-va-voom.\\u003c/a  As if all this story mode content wasn't enough to keep you wrapped up in your Robin PJs, Arkham Asylum also tosses in 16 challenge rooms for you to go nuts in. Again, these are broken up between 360-degree fighting and the Invisible Predator challenges, but there's more pressure thanks to the three medals for every event and the online leaderboards. For the straight fighting ones, you'll need to pull off certain scores to come away with one, two, or three medals. Getting the highest honor of three awards means that you're chaining together insane combos and decimating anyone who gets in your way. Eventually, you'll only have a certain amount of time to finish these fights. Meanwhile, in the Invisible Predator rounds, you'll get medals for pulling off certain feats such as zip-lining into an enemy and knocking him over a railing as well as blowing up three different walls while taking out three different enemies at the same time.     Personally, I wasn't sold when I first heard about these challenges -- I mean, they're in the same environments as the fights in the story, so it's kind of like you're just replaying certain levels again. However, once I started chasing scores on the leaderboards (which are displayed when you're browsing through the different challenges) and hunting the Trophy/Achievement for the 40-hit combo, I could see how great these sections were to just drop in and fight. Again, it's a blast to be Batman and take out crooks with flipping punches and well-timed Batarangs, so it's only more fun to do it as fast as possible and beat your buddy's score.    I've touched on how well-done and important characterization is in this game, but I do need to take a second and tell you how good the voice acting and sound is as well. There were plenty of times I'd find myself just sitting in an air duct listening to the Joker yammer over the loudspeaker. Mark Hamill is excellent in this game -- his inflection, his timing, and everything else is just spot-on. Thing is, he's not the exception to the rule -- Batman, Poison Ivy, the Riddler all sound excellent. Sure, some of the guards are hit or miss, but the characters you care about nail it. Add in the fact that you have an orchestral score that fits the dark, brooding mood of the game, and you have a title that is everything a Batman game's supposed to be in terms of mood.    \\u003c!--  --In terms of visual fidelity, Batman: Arkham Asylum looks great. The island is that right creepy/cool mix, and the fact that Batman's face and suit takes damage as the story progresses drives home how bad this night has been. Still, there is some screen tearing during the opening movie, CGI stuff has a tendency to get some pixelization, and the in-game cutscenes have guards with bug-eyes and shoddy lip syncing. None of those are giant issues, but they're there and it can hurt the presentation to see Joker wiggling his head around while talking to Batman but clearly never be looking at Batman.     If you want to start a flame war, the graphics tend to be sharper on the Xbox 360 when compared to the PS3, which packs a 1.2 GB install that lasts for three minutes. Still, it's not enough to matter in terms of how great this game truly is so don't expect a score difference in terms of reviews. Of course, the PS3 also has the exclusive ability to take on challenges as the Joker, but I'm not including that in this review because the Joker stuff isn't on the game disc -- it's free DLC you get from the PlayStation Store.\"],\"authorSocialDetails\":[{\"nickname\":null,\"name\":\"Greg Miller\",\"thumbnailUrl\":null,\"__typename\":\"Author\"}],\"__typename\":\"Article\",\"subHeadline\":\"Behold the greatest comic book game of all time.\",\"headerImageUrl\":null,\"showCommerceDisclaimer\":false,\"breadcrumbs\":[{\"id\":\"a03cfae3-3b17-4a4f-a389-53b142e00554\",\"url\":\"/games/batman-arkham-asylum\",\"slug\":\"batman-arkham-asylum\",\"metadata\":{\"names\":{\"name\":\"Batman: Arkham Asylum\",\"alt\":[],\"short\":null,\"__typename\":\"Names\"},\"__typename\":\"Metadata\"},\"objectRegions\":[{\"name\":\"Batman: Arkham Asylum\",\"shortName\":null,\"region\":\"US\",\"__typename\":\"ObjectRegion\"}],\"__typename\":\"Object\"}],\"review\":{\"blurb\":null,\"comment\":\"Batman: Arkham Asylum is the greatest comic book videogame of all time.

A revisionist retelling of the original entry in the famous film trilogy, it recast Luke, Han and Chewbacca as mercenary madmen -- running and gunning their way through Stormtroopers and civilians alike, all on their hair-pullingly difficult quest to blow the Empire apart into more shattered pieces than poor old Alderaan. \\u003csection data-transform=\\\"mobile-ad-break\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e Two weeks ago, \\u003cstrong\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\\"https://wii.ign.com/articles/101/1017354p1.html\\\"\\u003eSuper Empire Strikes Back\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/strong\\u003e kept the story going -- and again offered an action-enhanced version of the well-known movie, cramming extra explosions, alien monsters and cartwheeling heroics into every possible corner and crevice of the loosely-adapted plot. Luke, Han and Chewie were once again our stars, though each had gained more power and new abilities. Good thing, too, because Super Empire was even more insanely challenging than its predecessor. \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e Now, concluding the Virtual Console's vacation to the galaxy far, far away, we have \\u003ca class='autolink' href='https://wii.ign.com/objects/024/024855.html'\\u003eSuper Return of the Jedi\\u003c/a\\u003e. This third and final SNES adaptation of the original Star Wars trilogy is firmly rooted in the gameplay style of the two titles that came before it, but it may very well be the best of the three -- thanks to its refinement of each important game mechanic, its added polish and variety of level design, and the fact that, finally, Luke, Han and Chewie aren't the only ones getting to step into the playable spotlight. This time, we get Leia. \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e And she's wearing the gold bikini. \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e \\u003c!-- start image div  --\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"image-with-caption\\\" data-image-url=\\\"https://wiimedia.ign.com/wii/image/article/102/1022071/LeiaInline2_1252437367.jpg\\\" data-caption=\\\"You+can+see+Leia+working+her+chain+whip+in+the+slave+girl+outfit...\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003c!--- end image div --\\u003e \\u003cbr /\\u003e Striking with her length of slave chain like a Castlevania whip, Bikini Leia is an agile and intriguing addition to the Super Star Wars character roster -- and not just because she's the most nearly-naked mainstream 16-bit playable protagonist from the whole SNES era. She lashes out against Jabba's henchmen, spins herself in high-speed pirouettes across the ground like some kind of assassin ballerina and leaps through the air like a helicopter, twirling around in tornadic motion to do constant damage to any airborne enemies foolish enough to try to swoop in for the kill while she's busy hunting Hutts.  \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e This is a woman who's been denied cuddle time with her handsome smuggler boyfriend for months thanks to his prolonged carbonite cryo-sleep, you know. You don't want to get in her way. \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e So Leia's playstyle is unique, and would merit a look at Super Return on its appeal alone -- but there's more where that came from. Leia actually has a couple of other costume changes beyond the famous slave girl outfit, and each one brings, essentially, another entirely unique playable character into the mix. \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e The first outfit you see her in, actually, is the Boushh bounty hunter disguise from ROTJ's opening moments.

This third and final SNES adaptation of the original Star Wars trilogy is firmly rooted in the gameplay style of the two titles that came before it, but it may very well be the best of the three -- thanks to its refinement of each important game mechanic, its added polish and variety of level design, and the fact that, finally, Luke, Han and Chewie aren't the only ones getting to step into the playable spotlight.

She lashes out against Jabba's henchmen, spins herself in high-speed pirouettes across the ground like some kind of assassin ballerina and leaps through the air like a helicopter, twirling around in tornadic motion to do constant damage to any airborne enemies foolish enough to try to swoop in for the kill while she's busy hunting Hutts.  \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e This is a woman who's been denied cuddle time with her handsome smuggler boyfriend for months thanks to his prolonged carbonite cryo-sleep, you know.

Classic stuff. \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e The detonators become part of her playable arsenal in the game, too, along with a striking staff -- she can bash Gamorrean guards with the blunt side of the stick, or hold it in a blocking motion to absorb their assaults before counter-attacking, or spin through the air in a tight circle, lashing out with it to do damage across the full diameter of her rotation. Again, this is a wholly different style of character than Luke, Han and Chewie, and also different from her bikini look. \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e And then, later, Leia changes looks again when the story shifts settings to the forest moon of Endor -- there the princess dons her camo gear and cape from the film and finally picks up a blaster. \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e \\u003c!-- start image div  --\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"image-with-caption\\\" data-image-url=\\\"https://wiimedia.ign.com/wii/image/article/102/1022071/LeiaInline_1252448771.jpg\\\" data-caption=\\\"...but+you'll+have+to+get+through+the+Boushh+levels+first.\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003c!--- end image div --\\u003e \\u003cbr /\\u003e The many looks of Leia aren't the only enhancement Super Return of the Jedi boasts over its predecessors, as better tech under the hood fuels some of the game's vehicle sequences -- you can tell that the opening landspeeder level here has gotten more polish and attention than the equivalent level from Tatooine back in the first Super Star Wars, and the level where you and good old Lando pilot the Millennium Falcon into the heart of the Death Star near the end of the game approaches some of the style that Nintendo was achieving in the same era with titles like the first \\u003cstrong\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\\"https://cheats.ign.com/objects/007/007705.html\\\"\\u003eStar Fox\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/strong\\u003e. \\u003cbr /\\u003e  \\u003cbr /\\u003e There's more variety in the side-scrolling levels here, as some of them are straightforward while others are more open-ended, encouraging exploration to find hidden items like life-extending Health Swords.

Its story is largely poignant because of how self-contained it is: not knowing what happened between Joel and Ellie after his fateful, final decision burned a mark into the brains of many who played it, and that open-ended question has lingered for years. But with The Last of Us Part 2, developer Naughty Dog rises to that challenge with not only a complex, profound story that gives it a reason to exist, but also deep and satisfying evolutions to the original’s third-person action/stealth gameplay.\\u003c/p\\u003eI can’t tell you much about some of Part 2’s best aspects, but not because I don’t want to – I’m bursting to talk with anyone about all the moving, uplifting, and heart-wrenching moments that have been replaying in my mind for days since I first beat this adventure. But doing so would strip away layers of the act of playing through Part 2 yourself, so I’ll speak about its story in largely general terms.\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"mobile-ad-break\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"ignvideo\\\" data-slug=\\\"the-last-of-us-part-2-review-discussion-spoiler-free-beyond-episode-650\\\" data-loop=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003eOne of Part 2’s biggest achievements is how it knowingly handles the weighted expectations that a sequel to one of the most heralded game stories of all time will inevitably carry with fans. It starts out seemingly simple, taking place about four years after the end of the original and setting an older, angrier, but still-immune Ellie on a quest for revenge that also hones in on the cycles of violence that can plague humanity as much as any infection. It knowingly leans into the tropes of the genre, such as guilt by association and the inevitable escalation of matching an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. But those cliches are often subverted, playing into the expansive and not-so-straightforward path ahead.\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"quoteBox\\\"\\u003eEllie’s journey grows into something much more ambitious.\\u003c/section\\u003eFrom there, Ellie’s journey grows into something much more ambitious. Part 2 deftly handles a war on the streets of post-zombie-apocalypse Seattle, an expansive new cast of characters, and some gut-punch payoffs to the lingering emotions The Last of Us’ powerful ending left me stirring over for the last seven years. The Last of Us Part 2’s story is handled as masterfully as it was in the original.\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\n\\u003caside\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eShould I Play The Last of Us Before Part 2?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003eI’m going to talk about the events of the original The Last of Us a bit going forward, so if you haven’t played it yet please bail out and go do that immediately. Not only because it’s still an outstanding game, but playing through the original before Part 2 – especially relatively soon before – will make its big moments resonate so much more. Part 2 doesn’t necessarily rely on your ability to recall specific events and conversations, but it did play off the lingering emotions I’ve felt since playing the original.\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"ignvideo\\\" data-slug=\\\"the-last-of-us-review\\\" data-loop=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e \\u003csection data-transform=\\\"poll\\\" data-id=\\\"7935511d-84f7-4e7c-85e7-44741a360b47\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003c/aside\\u003eOne of the most impactful ways Part 2 hearkens back to The Last of Us is how it asks you to identify and empathize with its characters, even when you almost certainly won’t always agree with their actions. In a medium often defined by giving us the power to choose what happens, The Last of Us and Part 2 concern themselves more with fully realized characters, asking us to take them as they are. Naughty Dog’s characters are indelible, which makes for incredibly powerful and challenging moments when you’re put in Ellie's shoes and asked to act out her whims yourself.\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"ignvideo\\\" data-slug=\\\"8-minutes-of-the-last-of-us-part-2-gameplay\\\" data-loop=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003ePart 2 is peppered with brutal, tragic, and poignant moments that hit harder because you take part in them, like it or not. Even if I disagreed with an action, I didn’t have a choice in the matter. I was asked to execute those actions or watch them happen without a chance to intercede, and to understand the reasoning behind them from their perspective. This dance between interactivity and an unalterable story made for a much more affecting experience than if I’d watched it all unfold in a movie.\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\n\\u003caside\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003ePreorder The Last of Us Part 2\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\\"https://r.zdbb.net/u/bwd6\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003eSee it at Best Buy\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\\"https://r.zdbb.net/u/bwh0\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003eSee it at Amazon\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\\"https://r.zdbb.net/u/bwh1\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003eSee it at GameStop\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003c/aside\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eI Am Not Alone, Dear Loneliness\\u003c/h2\\u003eAt the heart of it all is Ellie and her relationships. Ellie has had time to both find herself in the Jackson, Wyoming settlement she and her flawed father figure Joel call home and to reflect on the formative moments of her childhood. Uncovering what she knows and where she stands with Joel and his brother Tommy, is, at different times painful, amusing, and cathartic, but always in ways that are true to what I knew of these characters.\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003eActors Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson once again bring so much heart and honesty in their performances as Joel and Ellie, respectively. Ellie is, without a doubt, the protagonist of Part 2, and Johnson brings nuance to every facet of Ellie’s character. Watching her grow up and wrestle with her past while still learning who she is as a 19-year-old (with all the usual desires and shortfalls 19-year-olds generally possess) is riveting at every step. She delivers some of the most human moments that Part 2 serves up.\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"slideshow\\\" data-slug=\\\"the-last-of-us-part-2-review-screenshots\\\" data-value=\\\"the-last-of-us-part-2-review-screenshots\\\" data-type=\\\"slug\\\" data-caption=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003eBaker is no less fantastic as Joel, even though Ellie is in the more prominent playable role. However you may feel about Joel’s decisions in the original, Baker sells the weariness of a man who has taken many lives to save his own and made questionable moral decisions out of love. Seeing him reckon with a surrogate daughter who both cares for him and yet keeps him at arm’s length is devastating to watch. Taking a cue from 2014’s prequel expansion, The Last of Us: Left Behind, Part 2 allowed me to live in moments between Joel and Ellie, which offered up a quiet reflection of why they view the world they do.\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"quoteBox\\\"\\u003eEven when she does horrible things, her motivations are just as legitimate as Joel's or Ellie's.\\u003c/section\\u003ePart 2 also introduces a great cast of supporting characters. Shannon Woodward is instantly charming as Dina, bringing a joy and kindness to a world where it’s otherwise so tough to find. Woodward shines in the smaller moments — a joking jab at Ellie here or an amusing aside about their Jackson homestead, there — offering so much dimension to the character. It’s also important to highlight, in spoiler-free terms, the incredible performance by Laura Bailey (known for her roles as Mary Jane from Marvel’s Spider-Man and Kait Diaz from Gears 5, among numerous others) as a new character. Like so many of The Last of Us’ characters, calling her good or evil would be reductive – we see her at her best and most relatable as well as her worst. It’s a testament to The Last of Us Part 2’s script by Neil Druckmann and Halley Gross and Bailey’s performance that even when she does horrible things, her motivations are just as legitimate and arguably noble as Joel’s or Ellie’s.\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003eIt takes a deft hand to write characters like this; those I wanted the best for even if they were doing despicable things. Some of the choices the characters made in Part 2 delighted me, others frustrated me, but I always wanted them to be better, and stronger, and see the goodness in themselves. In this regard, they felt incredibly human.\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"slideshow\\\" data-slug=\\\"every-ign-naughty-dog-game-review\\\" data-value=\\\"every-ign-naughty-dog-game-review\\\" data-type=\\\"slug\\\" data-caption=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003eThe way Naughty Dog uses the larger, community-based conflict between the warring groups in Seattle also helped avoid the fatigue that set in with the latter acts of Uncharted 4. Even though it took me about 25 hours to complete (10 hours longer than the original), Part 2 never dragged or felt padded out thanks to the large cast and Naughty Dog’s efforts to give each of them the screen time and story arc they deserve. Bringing so many perspectives to the forefront beautifully illustrates the larger ideas and conflicts in this world.\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eI Would Like to Rage\\u003c/h2\\u003eThose conflicts play out with some very familiar stealth, action, and puzzle sequences. That said, one of the biggest critiques of the first game is that its combat and puzzle segments weren’t deep enough to avoid repetition over its 15 hours, and Part 2 has taken major steps to remedy that and add variety to gameplay – some of which seem obvious in hindsight. For example, it’s silly to think that adding a jump button in 2020 could feel so fresh, but it most definitely proves to be key to Part 2’s many enthralling combat encounters. Ellie is far more nimble than Joel, able to jump, swing, and climb over and under things to more carefully avoid or stalk enemies. That not only made my options feel exponentially more varied, but also allowed the level design around these encounters to be more open and diverse at every step.\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003eFrom underground caverns to dilapidated office and apartment buildings to the lush, overgrown streets of a Seattle being reclaimed by nature, Part 2’s stealth combat is easy to understand but consistently exciting to try and master with every new fight. Part of that comes from the scope of its battlefields: they take place in areas like multi-tiered shopping malls or fragmented skyscrapers that offer what feel like naturally complex puzzle boxes. There was always plenty of room, both literally and mechanically, to sneak around and pick off enemies one by one, go in guns blazing, or (as usually happened for me) plan to be stealthy but get caught and scramble to narrowly escape danger.\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003eEllie’s ability to jump, go prone, dodge, and even run away from combat not only takes advantage of these large spaces, but also enables that improvisation within them, pushing you to adapt to any situation or meet a quick death. Enemies don’t just stick to set patterns; they’re reactive to the environment around them.\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"ignvideo\\\" data-slug=\\\"the-last-of-us-part-2-gameplay-mechanics-story-overview\\\" data-loop=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003eWhile giving every human enemy a name and the ability to communicate with each other more effectively while searching for you seems somewhat superfluous at first, the practical application of it was always clear after I’d killed an enemy or two in any given fight. The Washington Liberation Front enemies, seeing a friend or loved one dead on the ground, would immediately switch up their search pattern, taking note of recently downed enemies and possible escape routes the killer could have taken from that spot. Simply hearing my enemies verbally work through their plans, rather than just going about their patrol routes, instilled so much more tension into every fight.\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"quoteBox\\\"\\u003eLearning the ins and outs of each faction added another interesting layer to combat.\\u003c/section\\u003eThen there are the differences between the factions – learning the ins and outs of each added another interesting layer to combat. The Seraphites, battling with bows and arrows, use a whistling system to communicate, while the WLF members are more vocal and transparent, but carry a lot more firepower.\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003eAnd the Infected… well, they haven’t suddenly started talking, but their mob mentality is more threatening than ever. New enemies like the Shambler throw noxious spore bombs that cut off potential escape routes or obscure other enemies. The returning but more prevalent Stalkers are even scarier than before, pulling off a move Drax would be jealous of by making themselves invisible to Ellie’s returning radar-like Listen ability. They’ll use that silence to sneak up behind you, and when one attacks, it often means more are on the way. Fights with them, and a mixture of the many other Infected enemies with different abilities to take into account, led to several encounters that rivaled the best survival-horror experiences out there.\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"ignvideo\\\" data-slug=\\\"your-most-anticipated-2020-video-games-power-ranking\\\" data-loop=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003eThis is all to say enemies feel vastly more intelligent and varied in this sequel, and the little details make all the difference in combat: when alerted, enemies will check every inch of a map, including under cars and around each bit of cover, and their increased responsiveness to changes in the environment meant I could rarely sit still or rely on just one weapon. I loved that incentive to not only shake up my strategy but also become more familiar with any given area as quickly as possible.\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"quoteBox\\\"\\u003eI sometimes found myself choosing to be stealthy and non-lethal just to save myself from watching a brutal blow.\\u003c/section\\u003eAnd yes, despite all of the added nuance, Part 2 has some of the most bluntly brutal combat animations I’ve seen in any game, and it’s never played to a cartoonish degree the way something like Mortal Kombat does. It fits thematically with the tone, Ellie’s revenge-minded focus, and the violence those in power will use to control this post-pandemic society, but that doesn’t make the impact any less gruesome, and occasionally hard to stomach. The most frequent kill I witnessed was Ellie’s stealth takedown: a grab, stab, and slow, clumsy fall to the ground for every enemy I used it on. Shotguns are powerful and scary — just as Ellie can be knocked down, so too can an enemy. Choosing to fight – to graphically cut into an enemy’s throat or blast them against the wall with a shotgun – is tough to stomach in Part 2, intentionally so.\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003eAnd while it certainly reflects the reality of Ellie’s world, and its enemies reflect that character behavior back at you in powerful ways, I did sometimes find myself choosing to be stealthy and non-lethal just to save myself from watching a brutal blow. Avoiding combat entirely is often possible, but it’s rarely easy given how mobile and perceptive enemies are. I often had to sacrifice at least two or three enemies per encounter – especially when enemy dogs who can track Ellie’s scent are thrown into the mix.\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\n\\u003caside\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eAs a Dog Lover\\u003c/h2\\u003eIn The Last of Us Part 2, dogs are a major threat because they can sniff you out even when Ellie’s well-hidden from humans. You can distract them with throwable bottles or bricks, but if you don’t keep moving they’ll inevitably pick your scent back up. As a \\u003ca href=\\\"https://twitter.com/jmdornbush/status/1206428511038099462\\\"\\u003edog owner\\u003c/a\\u003e, I found it horrifying to be confronted with a situation in which I have to kill a dog (as opposed to a human who’s made a conscious decision to fight you to the death). No, they’re not real, but Naughty Dog has done an amazing job of animating their namesakes in lifelike ways. While you can’t feed treats to or play fetch with the dogs in the middle of battle, if it’s just too much to have to subdue one, I suggest sprinting away for your life. Dogs can pick up your scent, if you’re far enough away they become disinterested in you until they eventually amble closer to you on the map. Heights are your friend as well because, unlike Air Bud, there’s something in the Last of Us rulebook about dogs not being allowed to climb ladders. I often used those techniques to avoid watching Ellie do something I never could.\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\n\\u003c/aside\\u003ePart 2’s expansive environments aren’t just there to be sandboxes of death, though. The artfully detailed and realized locations tell layers of story, from the macro-destruction of a certain city district down to the posters and calendars hung on abandoned apartment walls. Some of the original Last of Us’ most interesting bits of backstory were found in scattered notes and diary pages, and the jump in detail for Part 2 astounded me. It seems as though every room has a story to tell, every office has a history, every store shows a place or group of people frozen in time. I spent more time than I’d care to admit studying abandoned D\\u0026amp;D games in apartments, listening to ancillary conversations, and trying to read deteriorating book covers. Whether I found equipment and crafting materials or not, the thoughtful intent in each one of these objects and interactions made exploring feel valuable regardless.\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"quoteBox\\\"\\u003eI never once had to grab a floating palette to serve as a raft for someone who couldn’t swim.\\u003c/section\\u003eEven better is that I never once had to navigate these areas by grabbing a floating palette to serve as a raft for someone who couldn’t swim, like the original so often asked us to do. Part 2’s environmental puzzles never feel as mindless as that – they have a lot more contextual challenges that make smart use of Ellie’s journey through skyscrapers, residential neighborhoods, sewers, plains, and more. From figuring out how to angle a rope to swing from one office to another locked room to navigating a perilous series of tripwires using Ellie’s new mobility to many more everyday tasks that take on new tension in a post-apocalypse setting, Part 2 makes much better use of its environment to offer unique, consistently engaging puzzles and platforming routes. And those clever designs are dressed with some of the most beautiful environments I’ve seen from the PlayStation 4/PlayStation 4 Pro generation.\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"slideshow\\\" data-slug=\\\"every-ign-playstation-first-party-exclusive-review\\\" data-value=\\\"every-ign-playstation-first-party-exclusive-review\\\" data-type=\\\"slug\\\" data-caption=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003eAnd while Part 2 is not an open-world game, it does include an open-world area that learns lessons from Uncharted 4 and Lost Legacy’s attempts at the same design idea, this time to much better effect. While those games presented areas of open, explorable wildernesses, they often didn’t have much to find there, making exploration feel somewhat aimless. In Part 2, though, a dilapidated district of Seattle offers years of lost history, a mixture of events frozen in time by the pandemic and those who have tried to survive here since. Its scope and scale won’t challenge Rockstar’s open-world games any time soon, but it shakes up the pacing in a needed way and is thoughtfully used by Naughty Dog to not only explain Part 2’s setting at large, but also allow for a number of welcome, discoverable character moments.\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"quoteBox\\\"\\u003eIts scope and scale won’t challenge Rockstar’s open-world games any time soon, but it shakes up the pacing in a needed way.\\u003c/section\\u003eBut even outside of that area, Jackson, other parts of Seattle, and more are gorgeous and memorable locations. The Wyoming countryside is lovely, too, whether it be mountains covered in bright snow or fields of wheat shining in the evening sunset. And sure, the Pacific Northwest is as rainy as you would expect, but Naughty Dog has taken the gloom of grey clouds and grey buildings and crafted something ominous, beautiful, and haunting. Lush vegetation grows over dilapidated storefronts and homes in the suburbs while the smashed, looming skyscrapers of the city form new, mesmerizing stone monuments. Seven years and a new generation has allowed Naughty Dog to create locations that, while very much like the ruined vestiges of civilization in the original, are so much more richly detailed, with more distinct and varied interiors, striking outdoor lighting, and inventive new locations that play to Seattle’s seaside setting.\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"slideshow\\\" data-slug=\\\"every-modern-ign-1010-and-where-to-play-them\\\" data-value=\\\"every-modern-ign-1010-and-where-to-play-them\\\" data-type=\\\"slug\\\" data-caption=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003eEvocative audio design, backed by the moving score of returning composer Gustavo Santaolalla, plays a big role as well. It all comes down to the little details: characteristically for the region, the oppressive thump of rain masks the terrifying noises of the infected that lurk outside; the slam of debris that blocks a doorway and the quiet creaking of an alternative exit; the slight hum of a silenced pistol versus the harrowing boom of a shotgun; and vocal performances from the guttural screams of the Clickers to the muttered self-reflection from Ellie as she kills an enemy.\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\n\\u003caside\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eImpressive Accessibility\\u003c/h2\\u003eNaughty Dog has introduced dozens of new accessibility options for The Last of Us Part 2, which go far beyond just full control customization and text font size changes. A variety of visual, audio, motion sickness, and control settings can be tweaked (check out the full options \\u003ca href=\\\"https://blog.playstation.com/2020/06/09/the-last-of-us-part-ii-accessibility-features-detailed/\\\"\\u003ehere\\u003c/a\\u003e), and some can even be turned off and on once activated with simple and smartly integrated swipes of the DualShock 4’s touchpad. As someone who does not necessarily need these options to play I can’t speak to their efficacy, but they’re impressively extensive on paper and their ease of use and customizability is certainly on a level I haven’t seen from Sony before. I hope this is a sign of things to come as we move into the PlayStation 5 generation.\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\n\\u003c/aside\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\"],\"authorSocialDetails\":[{\"nickname\":\"dornbush-ign\",\"name\":\"Jonathon Dornbush\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https://oyster.ignimgs.com/social/avatars/users2/09/10409105-1585328390.jpg\",\"__typename\":\"Author\"}],\"__typename\":\"Article\",\"subHeadline\":\"The best of us.\",\"headerImageUrl\":null,\"showCommerceDisclaimer\":true,\"breadcrumbs\":[{\"id\":\"70903702-2460-4dcb-b42c-d714adc633b0\",\"url\":\"/games/the-last-of-us-2\",\"slug\":\"the-last-of-us-2\",\"metadata\":{\"names\":{\"name\":\"The Last of Us Part II\",\"alt\":[\"TLoU 2\"],\"short\":\"The Last of Us 2\",\"__typename\":\"Names\"},\"__typename\":\"Metadata\"},\"objectRegions\":[{\"name\":\"The Last of Us Part II\",\"shortName\":\"The Last of Us 2\",\"region\":\"US\",\"__typename\":\"ObjectRegion\"}],\"__typename\":\"Object\"}],\"review\":{\"blurb\":\"The Last of Us Part 2 is a masterpiece that evolves the gameplay, cinematic storytelling, and rich world design of the original in nearly every way.\",\"comment\":\"The Last of Us Part 2 is a masterpiece worthy of its predecessor.

It starts out seemingly simple, taking place about four years after the end of the original and setting an older, angrier, but still-immune Ellie on a quest for revenge that also hones in on the cycles of violence that can plague humanity as much as any infection. It knowingly leans into the tropes of the genre, such as guilt by association and the inevitable escalation of matching an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. But those cliches are often subverted, playing into the expansive and not-so-straightforward path ahead.\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"quoteBox\\\"\\u003eEllie’s journey grows into something much more ambitious.\\u003c/section\\u003eFrom there, Ellie’s journey grows into something much more ambitious. Part 2 deftly handles a war on the streets of post-zombie-apocalypse Seattle, an expansive new cast of characters, and some gut-punch payoffs to the lingering emotions The Last of Us’ powerful ending left me stirring over for the last seven years. The Last of Us Part 2’s story is handled as masterfully as it was in the original.\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\n\\u003caside\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eShould I Play The Last of Us Before Part 2?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003eI’m going to talk about the events of the original The Last of Us a bit going forward, so if you haven’t played it yet please bail out and go do that immediately. Not only because it’s still an outstanding game, but playing through the original before Part 2 – especially relatively soon before – will make its big moments resonate so much more. Part 2 doesn’t necessarily rely on your ability to recall specific events and conversations, but it did play off the lingering emotions I’ve felt since playing the original.\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"ignvideo\\\" data-slug=\\\"the-last-of-us-review\\\" data-loop=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e \\u003csection data-transform=\\\"poll\\\" data-id=\\\"7935511d-84f7-4e7c-85e7-44741a360b47\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003c/aside\\u003eOne of the most impactful ways Part 2 hearkens back to The Last of Us is how it asks you to identify and empathize with its characters, even when you almost certainly won’t always agree with their actions. In a medium often defined by giving us the power to choose what happens, The Last of Us and Part 2 concern themselves more with fully realized characters, asking us to take them as they are. Naughty Dog’s characters are indelible, which makes for incredibly powerful and challenging moments when you’re put in Ellie's shoes and asked to act out her whims yourself.\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"ignvideo\\\" data-slug=\\\"8-minutes-of-the-last-of-us-part-2-gameplay\\\" data-loop=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003ePart 2 is peppered with brutal, tragic, and poignant moments that hit harder because you take part in them, like it or not. Even if I disagreed with an action, I didn’t have a choice in the matter. I was asked to execute those actions or watch them happen without a chance to intercede, and to understand the reasoning behind them from their perspective. This dance between interactivity and an unalterable story made for a much more affecting experience than if I’d watched it all unfold in a movie.\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\n\\u003caside\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003ePreorder The Last of Us Part 2\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\\"https://r.zdbb.net/u/bwd6\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003eSee it at Best Buy\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\\"https://r.zdbb.net/u/bwh0\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003eSee it at Amazon\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\\"https://r.zdbb.net/u/bwh1\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003eSee it at GameStop\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003c/aside\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eI Am Not Alone, Dear Loneliness\\u003c/h2\\u003eAt the heart of it all is Ellie and her relationships. Ellie has had time to both find herself in the Jackson, Wyoming settlement she and her flawed father figure Joel call home and to reflect on the formative moments of her childhood. Uncovering what she knows and where she stands with Joel and his brother Tommy, is, at different times painful, amusing, and cathartic, but always in ways that are true to what I knew of these characters.\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003eActors Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson once again bring so much heart and honesty in their performances as Joel and Ellie, respectively. Ellie is, without a doubt, the protagonist of Part 2, and Johnson brings nuance to every facet of Ellie’s character. Watching her grow up and wrestle with her past while still learning who she is as a 19-year-old (with all the usual desires and shortfalls 19-year-olds generally possess) is riveting at every step. She delivers some of the most human moments that Part 2 serves up.\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"slideshow\\\" data-slug=\\\"the-last-of-us-part-2-review-screenshots\\\" data-value=\\\"the-last-of-us-part-2-review-screenshots\\\" data-type=\\\"slug\\\" data-caption=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003eBaker is no less fantastic as Joel, even though Ellie is in the more prominent playable role. However you may feel about Joel’s decisions in the original, Baker sells the weariness of a man who has taken many lives to save his own and made questionable moral decisions out of love. Seeing him reckon with a surrogate daughter who both cares for him and yet keeps him at arm’s length is devastating to watch. Taking a cue from 2014’s prequel expansion, The Last of Us: Left Behind, Part 2 allowed me to live in moments between Joel and Ellie, which offered up a quiet reflection of why they view the world they do.\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"quoteBox\\\"\\u003eEven when she does horrible things, her motivations are just as legitimate as Joel's or Ellie's.\\u003c/section\\u003ePart 2 also introduces a great cast of supporting characters. Shannon Woodward is instantly charming as Dina, bringing a joy and kindness to a world where it’s otherwise so tough to find. Woodward shines in the smaller moments — a joking jab at Ellie here or an amusing aside about their Jackson homestead, there — offering so much dimension to the character. It’s also important to highlight, in spoiler-free terms, the incredible performance by Laura Bailey (known for her roles as Mary Jane from Marvel’s Spider-Man and Kait Diaz from Gears 5, among numerous others) as a new character. Like so many of The Last of Us’ characters, calling her good or evil would be reductive – we see her at her best and most relatable as well as her worst. It’s a testament to The Last of Us Part 2’s script by Neil Druckmann and Halley Gross and Bailey’s performance that even when she does horrible things, her motivations are just as legitimate and arguably noble as Joel’s or Ellie’s.\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003eIt takes a deft hand to write characters like this; those I wanted the best for even if they were doing despicable things. Some of the choices the characters made in Part 2 delighted me, others frustrated me, but I always wanted them to be better, and stronger, and see the goodness in themselves. In this regard, they felt incredibly human.\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"slideshow\\\" data-slug=\\\"every-ign-naughty-dog-game-review\\\" data-value=\\\"every-ign-naughty-dog-game-review\\\" data-type=\\\"slug\\\" data-caption=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003eThe way Naughty Dog uses the larger, community-based conflict between the warring groups in Seattle also helped avoid the fatigue that set in with the latter acts of Uncharted 4. Even though it took me about 25 hours to complete (10 hours longer than the original), Part 2 never dragged or felt padded out thanks to the large cast and Naughty Dog’s efforts to give each of them the screen time and story arc they deserve. Bringing so many perspectives to the forefront beautifully illustrates the larger ideas and conflicts in this world.\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eI Would Like to Rage\\u003c/h2\\u003eThose conflicts play out with some very familiar stealth, action, and puzzle sequences. That said, one of the biggest critiques of the first game is that its combat and puzzle segments weren’t deep enough to avoid repetition over its 15 hours, and Part 2 has taken major steps to remedy that and add variety to gameplay – some of which seem obvious in hindsight. For example, it’s silly to think that adding a jump button in 2020 could feel so fresh, but it most definitely proves to be key to Part 2’s many enthralling combat encounters. Ellie is far more nimble than Joel, able to jump, swing, and climb over and under things to more carefully avoid or stalk enemies. That not only made my options feel exponentially more varied, but also allowed the level design around these encounters to be more open and diverse at every step.\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003eFrom underground caverns to dilapidated office and apartment buildings to the lush, overgrown streets of a Seattle being reclaimed by nature, Part 2’s stealth combat is easy to understand but consistently exciting to try and master with every new fight. Part of that comes from the scope of its battlefields: they take place in areas like multi-tiered shopping malls or fragmented skyscrapers that offer what feel like naturally complex puzzle boxes. There was always plenty of room, both literally and mechanically, to sneak around and pick off enemies one by one, go in guns blazing, or (as usually happened for me) plan to be stealthy but get caught and scramble to narrowly escape danger.\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003eEllie’s ability to jump, go prone, dodge, and even run away from combat not only takes advantage of these large spaces, but also enables that improvisation within them, pushing you to adapt to any situation or meet a quick death. Enemies don’t just stick to set patterns; they’re reactive to the environment around them.\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"ignvideo\\\" data-slug=\\\"the-last-of-us-part-2-gameplay-mechanics-story-overview\\\" data-loop=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003eWhile giving every human enemy a name and the ability to communicate with each other more effectively while searching for you seems somewhat superfluous at first, the practical application of it was always clear after I’d killed an enemy or two in any given fight. The Washington Liberation Front enemies, seeing a friend or loved one dead on the ground, would immediately switch up their search pattern, taking note of recently downed enemies and possible escape routes the killer could have taken from that spot. Simply hearing my enemies verbally work through their plans, rather than just going about their patrol routes, instilled so much more tension into every fight.\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"quoteBox\\\"\\u003eLearning the ins and outs of each faction added another interesting layer to combat.\\u003c/section\\u003eThen there are the differences between the factions – learning the ins and outs of each added another interesting layer to combat. The Seraphites, battling with bows and arrows, use a whistling system to communicate, while the WLF members are more vocal and transparent, but carry a lot more firepower.\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003eAnd the Infected… well, they haven’t suddenly started talking, but their mob mentality is more threatening than ever. New enemies like the Shambler throw noxious spore bombs that cut off potential escape routes or obscure other enemies. The returning but more prevalent Stalkers are even scarier than before, pulling off a move Drax would be jealous of by making themselves invisible to Ellie’s returning radar-like Listen ability. They’ll use that silence to sneak up behind you, and when one attacks, it often means more are on the way. Fights with them, and a mixture of the many other Infected enemies with different abilities to take into account, led to several encounters that rivaled the best survival-horror experiences out there.\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"ignvideo\\\" data-slug=\\\"your-most-anticipated-2020-video-games-power-ranking\\\" data-loop=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003eThis is all to say enemies feel vastly more intelligent and varied in this sequel, and the little details make all the difference in combat: when alerted, enemies will check every inch of a map, including under cars and around each bit of cover, and their increased responsiveness to changes in the environment meant I could rarely sit still or rely on just one weapon. I loved that incentive to not only shake up my strategy but also become more familiar with any given area as quickly as possible.\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"quoteBox\\\"\\u003eI sometimes found myself choosing to be stealthy and non-lethal just to save myself from watching a brutal blow.\\u003c/section\\u003eAnd yes, despite all of the added nuance, Part 2 has some of the most bluntly brutal combat animations I’ve seen in any game, and it’s never played to a cartoonish degree the way something like Mortal Kombat does. It fits thematically with the tone, Ellie’s revenge-minded focus, and the violence those in power will use to control this post-pandemic society, but that doesn’t make the impact any less gruesome, and occasionally hard to stomach. The most frequent kill I witnessed was Ellie’s stealth takedown: a grab, stab, and slow, clumsy fall to the ground for every enemy I used it on. Shotguns are powerful and scary — just as Ellie can be knocked down, so too can an enemy. Choosing to fight – to graphically cut into an enemy’s throat or blast them against the wall with a shotgun – is tough to stomach in Part 2, intentionally so.\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003eAnd while it certainly reflects the reality of Ellie’s world, and its enemies reflect that character behavior back at you in powerful ways, I did sometimes find myself choosing to be stealthy and non-lethal just to save myself from watching a brutal blow. Avoiding combat entirely is often possible, but it’s rarely easy given how mobile and perceptive enemies are. I often had to sacrifice at least two or three enemies per encounter – especially when enemy dogs who can track Ellie’s scent are thrown into the mix.\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\n\\u003caside\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eAs a Dog Lover\\u003c/h2\\u003eIn The Last of Us Part 2, dogs are a major threat because they can sniff you out even when Ellie’s well-hidden from humans. You can distract them with throwable bottles or bricks, but if you don’t keep moving they’ll inevitably pick your scent back up. As a \\u003ca href=\\\"https://twitter.com/jmdornbush/status/1206428511038099462\\\"\\u003edog owner\\u003c/a\\u003e, I found it horrifying to be confronted with a situation in which I have to kill a dog (as opposed to a human who’s made a conscious decision to fight you to the death). No, they’re not real, but Naughty Dog has done an amazing job of animating their namesakes in lifelike ways. While you can’t feed treats to or play fetch with the dogs in the middle of battle, if it’s just too much to have to subdue one, I suggest sprinting away for your life. Dogs can pick up your scent, if you’re far enough away they become disinterested in you until they eventually amble closer to you on the map. Heights are your friend as well because, unlike Air Bud, there’s something in the Last of Us rulebook about dogs not being allowed to climb ladders. I often used those techniques to avoid watching Ellie do something I never could.\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\n\\u003c/aside\\u003ePart 2’s expansive environments aren’t just there to be sandboxes of death, though. The artfully detailed and realized locations tell layers of story, from the macro-destruction of a certain city district down to the posters and calendars hung on abandoned apartment walls. Some of the original Last of Us’ most interesting bits of backstory were found in scattered notes and diary pages, and the jump in detail for Part 2 astounded me. It seems as though every room has a story to tell, every office has a history, every store shows a place or group of people frozen in time. I spent more time than I’d care to admit studying abandoned D\\u0026amp;D games in apartments, listening to ancillary conversations, and trying to read deteriorating book covers. Whether I found equipment and crafting materials or not, the thoughtful intent in each one of these objects and interactions made exploring feel valuable regardless.\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"quoteBox\\\"\\u003eI never once had to grab a floating palette to serve as a raft for someone who couldn’t swim.\\u003c/section\\u003eEven better is that I never once had to navigate these areas by grabbing a floating palette to serve as a raft for someone who couldn’t swim, like the original so often asked us to do. Part 2’s environmental puzzles never feel as mindless as that – they have a lot more contextual challenges that make smart use of Ellie’s journey through skyscrapers, residential neighborhoods, sewers, plains, and more. From figuring out how to angle a rope to swing from one office to another locked room to navigating a perilous series of tripwires using Ellie’s new mobility to many more everyday tasks that take on new tension in a post-apocalypse setting, Part 2 makes much better use of its environment to offer unique, consistently engaging puzzles and platforming routes. And those clever designs are dressed with some of the most beautiful environments I’ve seen from the PlayStation 4/PlayStation 4 Pro generation.\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"slideshow\\\" data-slug=\\\"every-ign-playstation-first-party-exclusive-review\\\" data-value=\\\"every-ign-playstation-first-party-exclusive-review\\\" data-type=\\\"slug\\\" data-caption=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003eAnd while Part 2 is not an open-world game, it does include an open-world area that learns lessons from Uncharted 4 and Lost Legacy’s attempts at the same design idea, this time to much better effect. While those games presented areas of open, explorable wildernesses, they often didn’t have much to find there, making exploration feel somewhat aimless. In Part 2, though, a dilapidated district of Seattle offers years of lost history, a mixture of events frozen in time by the pandemic and those who have tried to survive here since. Its scope and scale won’t challenge Rockstar’s open-world games any time soon, but it shakes up the pacing in a needed way and is thoughtfully used by Naughty Dog to not only explain Part 2’s setting at large, but also allow for a number of welcome, discoverable character moments.\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"quoteBox\\\"\\u003eIts scope and scale won’t challenge Rockstar’s open-world games any time soon, but it shakes up the pacing in a needed way.\\u003c/section\\u003eBut even outside of that area, Jackson, other parts of Seattle, and more are gorgeous and memorable locations. The Wyoming countryside is lovely, too, whether it be mountains covered in bright snow or fields of wheat shining in the evening sunset. And sure, the Pacific Northwest is as rainy as you would expect, but Naughty Dog has taken the gloom of grey clouds and grey buildings and crafted something ominous, beautiful, and haunting. Lush vegetation grows over dilapidated storefronts and homes in the suburbs while the smashed, looming skyscrapers of the city form new, mesmerizing stone monuments. Seven years and a new generation has allowed Naughty Dog to create locations that, while very much like the ruined vestiges of civilization in the original, are so much more richly detailed, with more distinct and varied interiors, striking outdoor lighting, and inventive new locations that play to Seattle’s seaside setting.\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"slideshow\\\" data-slug=\\\"every-modern-ign-1010-and-where-to-play-them\\\" data-value=\\\"every-modern-ign-1010-and-where-to-play-them\\\" data-type=\\\"slug\\\" data-caption=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003eEvocative audio design, backed by the moving score of returning composer Gustavo Santaolalla, plays a big role as well. It all comes down to the little details: characteristically for the region, the oppressive thump of rain masks the terrifying noises of the infected that lurk outside; the slam of debris that blocks a doorway and the quiet creaking of an alternative exit; the slight hum of a silenced pistol versus the harrowing boom of a shotgun; and vocal performances from the guttural screams of the Clickers to the muttered self-reflection from Ellie as she kills an enemy.\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\n\\u003caside\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eImpressive Accessibility\\u003c/h2\\u003eNaughty Dog has introduced dozens of new accessibility options for The Last of Us Part 2, which go far beyond just full control customization and text font size changes. A variety of visual, audio, motion sickness, and control settings can be tweaked (check out the full options \\u003ca href=\\\"https://blog.playstation.com/2020/06/09/the-last-of-us-part-ii-accessibility-features-detailed/\\\"\\u003ehere\\u003c/a\\u003e), and some can even be turned off and on once activated with simple and smartly integrated swipes of the DualShock 4’s touchpad. As someone who does not necessarily need these options to play I can’t speak to their efficacy, but they’re impressively extensive on paper and their ease of use and customizability is certainly on a level I haven’t seen from Sony before. I hope this is a sign of things to come as we move into the PlayStation 5 generation.\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\n\\u003c/aside\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\"]},\"authorSocialDetails\":[{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":true,\"id\":\"Article:5ed54103e4b017964f12c678.authorSocialDetails.0\",\"typename\":\"Author\"}],\"object\":{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":false,\"id\":\"Object:70903702-2460-4dcb-b42c-d714adc633b0\",\"typename\":\"Object\"},\"__typename\":\"Article\",\"subHeadline\":\"The best of us.\",\"headerImageUrl\":null,\"showCommerceDisclaimer\":true,\"breadcrumbs\":[{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":false,\"id\":\"Object:70903702-2460-4dcb-b42c-d714adc633b0\",\"typename\":\"Object\"}],\"review\":{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":true,\"id\":\"$Article:5ed54103e4b017964f12c678.review\",\"typename\":\"Review\"},\"abTests\":[],\"hrefLangs\":{\"type\":\"json\",\"json\":{\"en-se\":\"https://nordic.ign.com/news/36730/read-igns-the-last-of-us-part-2-review-on-friday-june-12\"}},\"contentType\":\"Article\",\"promoTitle\":\"The Last of Us Part 2 Review\",\"duration\":480},\"Article:5ed54103e4b017964f12c678.authorSocialDetails.0\":{\"nickname\":\"dornbush-ign\",\"name\":\"Jonathon Dornbush\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https://oyster.ignimgs.com/social/avatars/users2/09/10409105-1585328390.jpg\",\"__typename\":\"Author\"},\"Object:70903702-2460-4dcb-b42c-d714adc633b0\":{\"id\":\"70903702-2460-4dcb-b42c-d714adc633b0\",\"parentId\":null,\"type\":\"Game\",\"enabled\":true,\"canceled\":false,\"slug\":\"the-last-of-us-2\",\"url\":\"/games/the-last-of-us-2\",\"psNow\":false,\"primaryReview\":{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":false,\"id\":\"Review:335741\",\"typename\":\"Review\"},\"metadata\":{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":true,\"id\":\"$Object:70903702-2460-4dcb-b42c-d714adc633b0.metadata\",\"typename\":\"Metadata\"},\"features\":[],\"franchises\":[],\"genres\":[{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":true,\"id\":\"Object:70903702-2460-4dcb-b42c-d714adc633b0.genres.0\",\"typename\":\"Attribute\"}],\"producers\":[{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":true,\"id\":\"Object:70903702-2460-4dcb-b42c-d714adc633b0.producers.0\",\"typename\":\"Attribute\"}],\"publishers\":[{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":true,\"id\":\"Object:70903702-2460-4dcb-b42c-d714adc633b0.publishers.0\",\"typename\":\"Attribute\"}],\"primaryImage\":{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":true,\"id\":\"$Object:70903702-2460-4dcb-b42c-d714adc633b0.primaryImage\",\"typename\":\"Image\"},\"commerce({\\\"region\\\":\\\"us\\\"})\":null,\"objectRegions({\\\"enabled\\\":true,\\\"region\\\":\\\"us\\\"})\":[{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":false,\"id\":\"ObjectRegion:1607027\",\"typename\":\"ObjectRegion\"}],\"__typename\":\"Object\",\"objectRegions({\\\"region\\\":\\\"us\\\"})\":[{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":true,\"id\":\"Object:70903702-2460-4dcb-b42c-d714adc633b0.objectRegions({\\\"region\\\":\\\"us\\\"}).0\",\"typename\":\"ObjectRegion\"}]},\"Review:335741\":{\"score\":10,\"editorsChoice\":true,\"articleUrl\":\"http://www.ign.com/articles/2020/06/12/the-last-of-us-part-2-review\",\"videoUrl\":null,\"__typename\":\"Review\",\"id\":\"335741\",\"scoreText\":\"masterpiece\",\"enabled\":true},\"$Object:70903702-2460-4dcb-b42c-d714adc633b0.metadata\":{\"state\":\"Published\",\"descriptions\":{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":true,\"id\":\"$Object:70903702-2460-4dcb-b42c-d714adc633b0.metadata.descriptions\",\"typename\":\"Description\"},\"names\":{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":true,\"id\":\"$Object:70903702-2460-4dcb-b42c-d714adc633b0.metadata.names\",\"typename\":\"Names\"},\"__typename\":\"Metadata\"},\"$Object:70903702-2460-4dcb-b42c-d714adc633b0.metadata.descriptions\":{\"long\":\"Strive to survive in this sequel to the hit action-adventure blockbuster release from Naughty Dog and Sony Interactive Entertainment.

really shines when it comes to the graphics. Gorgeous backgrounds and silky smooth animation make this one of the best-looking titles available for the PlayStation.

Any platform games needs spot on control, and this game definitely has it. The Sony Analog Controller is a must for the game, but I needed to switch back and forth between analog and digital depending on the make-up of the particular level. This, of course, as easy as hitting a button, and is not a slight on the game. The high-res graphics are, of course, beautiful as well.\\n\\nUltimately, Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back is a splendid game.

It still brings enough freshness (in the form of its semi free-roaming portions and new play mechanics) and refinement to the table to suit my tastes just fine. Not only that, it's an incredibly fun game.\\n\\nCrash fans, I've got good news: Warped is a winner.

I feel a little like Crash and Lara Croft have something in common, which is that I've seen too much of them in the last four years. I know it's terrible to say, but I'm kinda of sick of Crash Bandicoot, and I could take a big long vacation from him and his comical dance for a long while. It took me a long time to get into this game because every time I look at Crash can see dollar signs blinking in his eyes. Once I got past that major obstacle, I faced the game's all too familiar feel and structure, which depressed me. Finally, after getting about 50% into the game, through sheer force, I started liking it.\\n\\nBut most folks have only a few choices come the winter the winter holidays. So, here's the bottom line, all cynicism aside. Like I said in the beginning, once you get past the insanely capitalistic smile of Crash, the game is rock solid in playability and graphics. Hell! It's a four-player kart game that's on the PlayStation. Isn't that enough? I mean, not only that, but none of the problems of the other kart games even exist in this one. So what's all the fuss about? If you want a pure party game -- and the best kart game on PlayStation or Nintendo, for that matter -- get Crash Team Racing. \",\"embargoDate\":null,\"__typename\":\"Image\"},\"Image:ba03045c-aac8-4faf-97a9-77b69c4d51ce\":{\"id\":\"ba03045c-aac8-4faf-97a9-77b69c4d51ce\",\"url\":\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2020/05/14/jak-and-daxter-the-precursor-legacy-1589423060916.png\",\"caption\":\"\\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/12/05/jak-and-daxter-the-precursor-legacy\\\"\\u003eReviewed by David Zdyrko\\u003c/a\\u003e\\n\\u003cbr\\u003eDecember 4, 2001\\u003cbr\\u003e\\nIt's kind of funny thinking back to the day that we were heading down to Sony to play Jak and Daxter for the very first time. On the way, we were talking about how we've all grown tired of the 3D platformer genre and thought that the design philosophy of continuously collecting stuff had been done to death and needed to be done away with completely. And then upon seeing that Jak and Daxter was just another straightforward game of this kind, albeit a gorgeous one, we couldn't help but be at least somewhat disappointed by Naughty Dog's mystery game.\\n\\nThis disappointment would soon change to wonderment and excitement with each subsequent time that I got to play the game. The more I played Jak and Daxter, the more that I realized that this game was really something special. It has that magical feeling that not all games can possess and it's just flat out a joy to play. This is one of the few games that I can't help but smile and have fun when I'm playing. Jak and Daxter is a true 3D platform/adventure masterpiece and one of the top games ever released in the genre, easily on par with some of the all time greats released by the likes of Nintendo and Rare. \",\"embargoDate\":null,\"__typename\":\"Image\"},\"Image:49fdf904-c43a-4aef-b91c-6ae8b163982c\":{\"id\":\"49fdf904-c43a-4aef-b91c-6ae8b163982c\",\"url\":\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2020/05/14/jak-ii-1589423062540.png\",\"caption\":\"\\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/10/10/jak-ii-2\\\"\\u003eReviewed by Douglass C.

When I'm at my most ADD, this game grabs my attention. When I'm totally mellow and not distractable at all, the variety of missions, and the level of the challenge (it's hard but not brutal, which is the perfect pitch for me) pull at my thumbs.\\n\\nIf I look at the game as an action game, or as an adventure game, it's stunningly good, fat with great shooting levels, vehicle jacking, hovercraft missions, and some superb racing courses. Of course, the story is what drives this game forward, but it's the perfect blend of platforming elements and action-shooting that are so good, feel so right -- and with guns that feel so good -- that in the end, I don't give a damn what genre this game actually falls under.

It's a beautiful, fun game with tons of collectibles, plenty of laughs, and some cool twists on a franchise PlayStation fans know so well.

Right from the start, the vast landscape of Hyrule is thrown completely open to you, and it constantly finds ways to pique your curiosity with mysterious landmarks, complex hidden puzzles, and enemy camps to raid for treasure and weapons. The fact that you can tackle any one of these things at your own pace and almost never get pulled to the main path is liberating, but the way all of Breath of the Wild’s systems fit elegantly into complex light survival game is even more impressive. I’ve been running around for over 50 hours and I still have plenty of mysteries left to track down and lots of wonderfully crafted puzzles to solve. I’m in awe of the scope and scale of this adventure, and I often find myself counting the hours until I can get back in.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"mobile-ad-break\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003eThe untamed, post-apocalyptic, techno-fantasy land of Hyrule is the main character in Breath of the Wild. Not only is it vast, beautiful, and filled with a diverse set of locations from grassy fields to craggy alpine mountains, but it follows surprisingly realistic rules that let you pull off solutions so intuitive that you might be surprised they actually work. The trees bear fruit, grass fields can be set ablaze, and even enemies and animals behave in a believable manner, based on the skittish and aggressive reactions I’ve seen in the wild. But the realistic touches don’t end there. Each object you encounter, from sticks to apples to rocks and metallic blocks, is made of a material, and those materials usually respond to forces like fire and magnetism as you’d expect.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"ignvideo\\\" data-slug=\\\"15-minutes-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-on-nintendo-switch\\\" data-loop=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003eIt all sets up a surprisingly fun and responsive sandbox to interact with, and one I’ve rarely seen executed so well in an action-adventure game. If you think something should work, it usually does, and that led me to all kinds of fun and hilarious experimentation. You can stand under an apple tree with a torch and bake the fruit into a quick-healing snack before you even pick it, or drop a metal sword in front of a weaponless enemy and watch it get fried by a bolt of lighting. Meanwhile, Link needs warmer clothes to survive the cold and flame-resistant gear to near the volcanic Death Mountain. It’s consistently amazing to learn how all of these systems interact with each other while you play.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"ignvideo\\\" data-slug=\\\"5-ways-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-defies-expectations\\\" data-loop=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"quoteBox\\\"\\u003eWhat elevates Breath of Wild above its contemporaries is its sheer freedom.\\u003c/section\\u003eBut what elevates Breath of Wild above its open-world contemporaries is its sheer freedom, both in its non-linear questing structure and in your ability to climb almost any surface and travel in any direction once you leave the starting area. It is the heart of what makes this action-adventure game truly special and addictive. Like many open-world games it delivers on the implied promise that if you can see it out in the distance, chances are you can eventually reach it – but here, figuring out how to get there is more often than not a satisfying puzzle in itself, and one that never gets old. For instance, a tantalizing island far off the coast of the mainland was just out of my paragliding reach for the first several hours until after I’d upgraded my abilities. When I finally did, what took place when I finally reached my objective was a great twist that blew my mind – including finding an easier alternate route I’d missed.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003eThat paraglider is easily one of the most useful tools in Breath of the Wild because it's so versatile. You can use it to effortlessly glide across lakes and gaps or ride updrafts into new areas, and I often used each long trip across the map as a way to scan the marvelously lit horizon in search of clues or meditate on what I need to do next.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"slideshow\\\" data-slug=\\\"every-ign-zelda-review-score\\\" data-value=\\\"every-ign-zelda-review-score\\\" data-type=\\\"slug\\\" data-caption=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e]\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003eFrom overhead you get a glimpse of what’s even more evident from the ground: each individual area has its own little ecology, and systems built around extreme hot and cold temperatures and high altitudes mean you have to take the time to think and prepare in order to travel safely through them. It doesn’t matter, for example, if you can glide into the chilly mountains if you’ll freeze to death before you hit the ground. Going in with the right equipment makes all the difference.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"recirc\\\" data-recirc-type=\\\"articles%2Cvideos\\\" data-recirc-title=\\\"More Nintendo Switch Reviews\\\" data-recirc-tags=\\\"switch-reviews\\\" data-recirc-count=\\\"6\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003eAs you continue to improve Link’s stamina meter and skills you can reach even more of these varied locations. But no matter how much stronger you get, the world and its resident Mother Nature is always more powerful than you will ever be. Random events like rain and thunderstorms slow down your movement across slick surfaces, and dangerous lightning bolts can strike with little warning if you’re wearing any metal. Additionally, the day/night cycle is constantly running, and makes meaningful differences: nighttime brings monsters that spring up from the ground, it's easier to spot some useful bugs and plants, and other secrets that are best discovered for yourself. These are all constant reminders that you are always at the mercy of the world itself.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"ignvideo\\\" data-slug=\\\"10-new-things-weve-seen-in-zelda-breath-of-the-wild\\\" data-loop=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003eYet there are still pockets of serenity and beauty spread throughout the gorgeous, tantalizing landscape. In these moments, subtle music queues matched the tempo of my adventure, swaying between playful piano melodies and ambient sounds of wildlife. In the foreground, Breath of the Wild’s anime-inspired art style is colorful, remarkably lively, and beautifully animated, but it comes at the cost of brief framerate hiccups and object pop-in that’s most noticeable when you’re playing the Switch in TV mode, where it renders at 900p, and when there are a lot of physics particle effects flying around the screen. The issues are less frequent playing on in portable mode on the 720p screen, but regardless of where I played the performance problems never significantly soured my gameplay. Performance on the Wii U version is roughly the same as the Switch, although it's important to note it renders at 720p. This makes the jaggies a little more visible and lighting appear slightly different. Otherwise, it looks good on Wii U.\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"sub-header\\\" data-label=\\\"Extreme Chef\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"quoteBox\\\"\\u003eThe light and flexible cooking system offers lots of opportunity to experiment.\\u003c/section\\u003eUnlike a lot of survival games in which every item you use must be created from felled trees and dug-up minerals, Breath of the Wild focuses all its crafting systems on cooking. It’s a light and flexible system that offers lots of opportunity for experimenting with different ingredient combinations to help you survive. Raw food and quick-and-dirty snacks cooked by a fire will replenish a small amount of health, but the most interesting and stat-boosting dishes come from tossing ingredients into a pot to make a hearty meal. I’ve spent many hours figuring out the best recipes by using clues noted in the ingredient descriptions to come up with effects like stamina boosts and elemental resistances of various potencies, and I loved that whenever I got a little carried away with the my recipes I ended up with a censored-out dish appropriately called Dubious Food that’s apparently too disgusting to even look at. Making buff-imbuing potions is equally as flexible, and you’ll find plenty of bugs and monster parts with which to mix up a special brew.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\",\"\\u003csection class=\\\"article-page\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003eThe art of cooking is a relatively small feature, but like Breath of the Wild’s other components, every piece of this sandbox feels meticulously thought out, and almost every action has a natural consequence that makes sense.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"mobile-ad-break\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"sub-header\\\" data-label=\\\"Just the Right Tools\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"ignvideo\\\" data-slug=\\\"[ignvideo url=\\\" data-loop=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003eBreath of the Wild’s skillful combat is as approachable as it is deep, but you’ll need to study its nuances if you want to survive in the late game. Link can still use swords, spears, and axes (as well as other amusing blunt objects) he finds in the world, but for the first time in the Zelda series they’ll wear down and eventually break from use, which fits perfectly with the survival angle. Especially in the early game, when most item durability is low, you’re constantly swapping out weapons, never getting too attached to one sword or hammer and always ready to improvise by, say, picking up a bony limb of a downed Stal Bokoblin and using it to finish off the last of a group of enemies.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"quoteBox\\\"\\u003eBreath of the Wild’s skillful combat is as approachable as it is deep.\\u003c/section\\u003eBut no matter how prepared you think you are, you can still run into large Moblins and other enemies that can slay you in one hit. Naturally, as you make progress in the main quest you’ll gain access to empowering special abilities that will improve your chances to survive, but to say more about them would be spoiler territory. I like that Nintendo allows you to switch certain items off and continue using the most basic tools if you feel these they’re too powerful, creating an informal hardcore mode.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003eArchery plays a much bigger role in combat this time around, and it’s for the better. Link can quickly pull out his bow and take aim at enemies at any time, using a wide range of arrow types (like ice and fire) to take advantage of their weaknesses. The metallic ping you hear whenever you land a headshot is an immediately satisfying treat, as are the slow-motion attacks initiated by jumping off of high places and drawing your bow as you fall toward a batch of enemies below. Since the duration of this arrow-time effect is dictated by your stamina, early on it feels like you rarely have a huge advantage. A few stamina upgrades will buy you more time, but the stronger enemies you’ll face on the outer fringes of Hyrule can usually withstand several headshots, which brings it back into balance.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"ignvideo\\\" data-slug=\\\"24-hours-in-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-on-nintendo-switch\\\" data-loop=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003eThe way you can work the glider into combat is equally impressive and it makes for some engagingly versatile, skill-based action. Link can glide in, let go of the glider, and go into slow motion to fire off a few headshots, then grab hold of the glider again only to fall and downward-stab another unsuspecting enemy. The combat is open enough that it inspires more of the same playful experimentation as the world itself.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"quoteBox\\\"\\u003eBreath of the Wild tosses difficult encounters at you early on.\\u003c/section\\u003eTense boss fights against larger foes are still a major highlight of the Zelda series, and Breath of the Wild tosses up more difficult encounters at you pretty early on, such as the imposing rock monster named Steppe Talus who will come right out of the ground. If you feel overwhelmed, you can always run away and come back to them later, and these emergent challenges add another welcome layer of danger to the survival sandbox. And you’ll find plenty more optional bosses well-hidden in this massive world.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"ignvideo\\\" data-slug=\\\"zelda-breath-of-the-wild-3-new-minutes-of-gameplay\\\" data-loop=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003eOn the other hand, dungeon bosses are challenging face-offs you can’t run away from. They’re as big on spectacle as ever, and my favorite ones involve ingenious combat puzzles where you need to use your Shekiah Slate, a powerful tool given to you early on that gives you special abilities like magnetising metal objects or creating bombs, to weaken the boss before you can take it down.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"sub-header\\\" data-label=\\\"Puzzling Mementos\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003eThe Sheikah Slate is a major piece of the main quest, which puts Link on a journey to reclaim his memories of Princess Zelda after an apocalyptic event left Hyrule in ruins. It took me roughly 40 hours to slay the final boss and piece together what happened 100 years ago. While most Zelda games are rooted in heavy tradition, this coming-of-age story is anything but and has plenty of charming characters and surprises to reveal. It’s amazing that it works so well while letting you tackle its dungeons in any order you want.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"quoteBox\\\"\\u003eMy favorite quests involved piecing together a series of clues.\\u003c/section\\u003eHundreds of NPCs waiting to send you on side quests and puzzle shrines pepper the landscape, and there’s even more to discover hidden behind vague clues. The fetch-questy ones aren’t as interesting as the bonafide rabbit holes of The Witcher 3, but they still introduce you to interesting characters and dole out helpful info, meals, and materials. My favorite quests involved piecing together a series of clues: in one example, a wandering minstrel sang a mysterious song that dropped hints as to the location of a special shrine. Some don’t even show up as quests in your log, so you have to pay attention.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"ignvideo\\\" data-slug=\\\"the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-gameplay-compilation-trailer\\\" data-loop=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003ePuzzle shrines yield their own useful rewards in the form of materials and handy weapon upgrades. These shrines involve short, inventive puzzle rooms which present you with a few clues and leave your to experiment in order to solve them. There’s a wide variety of them and a majority are excellent little puzzles to figure out, but a few of the combat-focused challenges are repeated and another handful use motion controls that just don’t feel quite as sharp enough due to wonky physics.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"quoteBox\\\"\\u003eMotion controls don't feel quite as sharp.\\u003c/section\\u003eStill, the techniques you learn from Shrines become essential training for Breath of the Wild’s fantastic dungeons. For the sake of avoiding spoilers I won’t go into too much detail, but these daunting, massive logic puzzles demand that you look at all the moving pieces in order to solve them. But every time I came across a new Shrine I was excited to uncover whatever new challenge it contained, with some Shrines in particular feeling as intricate as early levels in Portal, because they hinted at something much bigger and more impressive to come.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003eThere are even more cryptic challenges throughout Hyrule, some hidden behind riddles, and others are large mazes or other inventive ideas. Even after 50 hours, I still can’t believe I haven’t seen almost everything, but the surprises keep on coming. I estimate it would take over 100 hours to solve every side quest, puzzle, and collectible. It is a truly massive game to tackle.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\"],\"authorSocialDetails\":[{\"nickname\":\"jotero_IGN\",\"name\":\"Jose Otero\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"http://oyster.ignimgs.com/social/avatars/users2/14/5947705-1374546241.jpg\",\"__typename\":\"Author\"}],\"__typename\":\"Article\",\"subHeadline\":\"An evocative and exhilarating open-world adventure game.\",\"headerImageUrl\":\"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/03/02/zeldabotw-1600-1488422500370.jpg\",\"showCommerceDisclaimer\":false,\"breadcrumbs\":[{\"id\":\"7b45c687-92d8-421b-a693-5703face2de2\",\"url\":\"/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild\",\"slug\":\"the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild\",\"metadata\":{\"names\":{\"name\":\"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\",\"alt\":[\"The Legend of Zelda Wii U / The Legend of Zelda NX\",\"The Legend of Zelda HD\",\"Zelda\"],\"short\":\"Zelda: Breath of the Wild\",\"__typename\":\"Names\"},\"__typename\":\"Metadata\"},\"objectRegions\":[{\"name\":\"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\",\"shortName\":\"Zelda: Breath of the Wild\",\"region\":\"US\",\"__typename\":\"ObjectRegion\"}],\"__typename\":\"Object\"}],\"review\":{\"blurb\":\"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is evocative, exhilarating, and a masterclass in open-world design.\",\"comment\":\"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a masterclass in open-world design and a watershed game that reinvents a 30-year-old franchise.

Right from the start, the vast landscape of Hyrule is thrown completely open to you, and it constantly finds ways to pique your curiosity with mysterious landmarks, complex hidden puzzles, and enemy camps to raid for treasure and weapons. The fact that you can tackle any one of these things at your own pace and almost never get pulled to the main path is liberating, but the way all of Breath of the Wild’s systems fit elegantly into complex light survival game is even more impressive. I’ve been running around for over 50 hours and I still have plenty of mysteries left to track down and lots of wonderfully crafted puzzles to solve. I’m in awe of the scope and scale of this adventure, and I often find myself counting the hours until I can get back in.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"mobile-ad-break\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003eThe untamed, post-apocalyptic, techno-fantasy land of Hyrule is the main character in Breath of the Wild. Not only is it vast, beautiful, and filled with a diverse set of locations from grassy fields to craggy alpine mountains, but it follows surprisingly realistic rules that let you pull off solutions so intuitive that you might be surprised they actually work. The trees bear fruit, grass fields can be set ablaze, and even enemies and animals behave in a believable manner, based on the skittish and aggressive reactions I’ve seen in the wild. But the realistic touches don’t end there. Each object you encounter, from sticks to apples to rocks and metallic blocks, is made of a material, and those materials usually respond to forces like fire and magnetism as you’d expect.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"ignvideo\\\" data-slug=\\\"15-minutes-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-on-nintendo-switch\\\" data-loop=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003eIt all sets up a surprisingly fun and responsive sandbox to interact with, and one I’ve rarely seen executed so well in an action-adventure game. If you think something should work, it usually does, and that led me to all kinds of fun and hilarious experimentation. You can stand under an apple tree with a torch and bake the fruit into a quick-healing snack before you even pick it, or drop a metal sword in front of a weaponless enemy and watch it get fried by a bolt of lighting. Meanwhile, Link needs warmer clothes to survive the cold and flame-resistant gear to near the volcanic Death Mountain. It’s consistently amazing to learn how all of these systems interact with each other while you play.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"ignvideo\\\" data-slug=\\\"5-ways-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-defies-expectations\\\" data-loop=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"quoteBox\\\"\\u003eWhat elevates Breath of Wild above its contemporaries is its sheer freedom.\\u003c/section\\u003eBut what elevates Breath of Wild above its open-world contemporaries is its sheer freedom, both in its non-linear questing structure and in your ability to climb almost any surface and travel in any direction once you leave the starting area. It is the heart of what makes this action-adventure game truly special and addictive. Like many open-world games it delivers on the implied promise that if you can see it out in the distance, chances are you can eventually reach it – but here, figuring out how to get there is more often than not a satisfying puzzle in itself, and one that never gets old. For instance, a tantalizing island far off the coast of the mainland was just out of my paragliding reach for the first several hours until after I’d upgraded my abilities. When I finally did, what took place when I finally reached my objective was a great twist that blew my mind – including finding an easier alternate route I’d missed.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003eThat paraglider is easily one of the most useful tools in Breath of the Wild because it's so versatile. You can use it to effortlessly glide across lakes and gaps or ride updrafts into new areas, and I often used each long trip across the map as a way to scan the marvelously lit horizon in search of clues or meditate on what I need to do next.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"slideshow\\\" data-slug=\\\"every-ign-zelda-review-score\\\" data-value=\\\"every-ign-zelda-review-score\\\" data-type=\\\"slug\\\" data-caption=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e]\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003eFrom overhead you get a glimpse of what’s even more evident from the ground: each individual area has its own little ecology, and systems built around extreme hot and cold temperatures and high altitudes mean you have to take the time to think and prepare in order to travel safely through them. It doesn’t matter, for example, if you can glide into the chilly mountains if you’ll freeze to death before you hit the ground. Going in with the right equipment makes all the difference.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"recirc\\\" data-recirc-type=\\\"articles%2Cvideos\\\" data-recirc-title=\\\"More Nintendo Switch Reviews\\\" data-recirc-tags=\\\"switch-reviews\\\" data-recirc-count=\\\"6\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003eAs you continue to improve Link’s stamina meter and skills you can reach even more of these varied locations. But no matter how much stronger you get, the world and its resident Mother Nature is always more powerful than you will ever be. Random events like rain and thunderstorms slow down your movement across slick surfaces, and dangerous lightning bolts can strike with little warning if you’re wearing any metal. Additionally, the day/night cycle is constantly running, and makes meaningful differences: nighttime brings monsters that spring up from the ground, it's easier to spot some useful bugs and plants, and other secrets that are best discovered for yourself. These are all constant reminders that you are always at the mercy of the world itself.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"ignvideo\\\" data-slug=\\\"10-new-things-weve-seen-in-zelda-breath-of-the-wild\\\" data-loop=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003eYet there are still pockets of serenity and beauty spread throughout the gorgeous, tantalizing landscape. In these moments, subtle music queues matched the tempo of my adventure, swaying between playful piano melodies and ambient sounds of wildlife. In the foreground, Breath of the Wild’s anime-inspired art style is colorful, remarkably lively, and beautifully animated, but it comes at the cost of brief framerate hiccups and object pop-in that’s most noticeable when you’re playing the Switch in TV mode, where it renders at 900p, and when there are a lot of physics particle effects flying around the screen. The issues are less frequent playing on in portable mode on the 720p screen, but regardless of where I played the performance problems never significantly soured my gameplay. Performance on the Wii U version is roughly the same as the Switch, although it's important to note it renders at 720p. This makes the jaggies a little more visible and lighting appear slightly different. Otherwise, it looks good on Wii U.\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"sub-header\\\" data-label=\\\"Extreme Chef\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"quoteBox\\\"\\u003eThe light and flexible cooking system offers lots of opportunity to experiment.\\u003c/section\\u003eUnlike a lot of survival games in which every item you use must be created from felled trees and dug-up minerals, Breath of the Wild focuses all its crafting systems on cooking. It’s a light and flexible system that offers lots of opportunity for experimenting with different ingredient combinations to help you survive. Raw food and quick-and-dirty snacks cooked by a fire will replenish a small amount of health, but the most interesting and stat-boosting dishes come from tossing ingredients into a pot to make a hearty meal. I’ve spent many hours figuring out the best recipes by using clues noted in the ingredient descriptions to come up with effects like stamina boosts and elemental resistances of various potencies, and I loved that whenever I got a little carried away with the my recipes I ended up with a censored-out dish appropriately called Dubious Food that’s apparently too disgusting to even look at. Making buff-imbuing potions is equally as flexible, and you’ll find plenty of bugs and monster parts with which to mix up a special brew.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\",\"\\u003csection class=\\\"article-page\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003eThe art of cooking is a relatively small feature, but like Breath of the Wild’s other components, every piece of this sandbox feels meticulously thought out, and almost every action has a natural consequence that makes sense.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"mobile-ad-break\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"sub-header\\\" data-label=\\\"Just the Right Tools\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"ignvideo\\\" data-slug=\\\"[ignvideo url=\\\" data-loop=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003eBreath of the Wild’s skillful combat is as approachable as it is deep, but you’ll need to study its nuances if you want to survive in the late game. Link can still use swords, spears, and axes (as well as other amusing blunt objects) he finds in the world, but for the first time in the Zelda series they’ll wear down and eventually break from use, which fits perfectly with the survival angle. Especially in the early game, when most item durability is low, you’re constantly swapping out weapons, never getting too attached to one sword or hammer and always ready to improvise by, say, picking up a bony limb of a downed Stal Bokoblin and using it to finish off the last of a group of enemies.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"quoteBox\\\"\\u003eBreath of the Wild’s skillful combat is as approachable as it is deep.\\u003c/section\\u003eBut no matter how prepared you think you are, you can still run into large Moblins and other enemies that can slay you in one hit. Naturally, as you make progress in the main quest you’ll gain access to empowering special abilities that will improve your chances to survive, but to say more about them would be spoiler territory. I like that Nintendo allows you to switch certain items off and continue using the most basic tools if you feel these they’re too powerful, creating an informal hardcore mode.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003eArchery plays a much bigger role in combat this time around, and it’s for the better. Link can quickly pull out his bow and take aim at enemies at any time, using a wide range of arrow types (like ice and fire) to take advantage of their weaknesses. The metallic ping you hear whenever you land a headshot is an immediately satisfying treat, as are the slow-motion attacks initiated by jumping off of high places and drawing your bow as you fall toward a batch of enemies below. Since the duration of this arrow-time effect is dictated by your stamina, early on it feels like you rarely have a huge advantage. A few stamina upgrades will buy you more time, but the stronger enemies you’ll face on the outer fringes of Hyrule can usually withstand several headshots, which brings it back into balance.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"ignvideo\\\" data-slug=\\\"24-hours-in-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-on-nintendo-switch\\\" data-loop=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003eThe way you can work the glider into combat is equally impressive and it makes for some engagingly versatile, skill-based action. Link can glide in, let go of the glider, and go into slow motion to fire off a few headshots, then grab hold of the glider again only to fall and downward-stab another unsuspecting enemy. The combat is open enough that it inspires more of the same playful experimentation as the world itself.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"quoteBox\\\"\\u003eBreath of the Wild tosses difficult encounters at you early on.\\u003c/section\\u003eTense boss fights against larger foes are still a major highlight of the Zelda series, and Breath of the Wild tosses up more difficult encounters at you pretty early on, such as the imposing rock monster named Steppe Talus who will come right out of the ground. If you feel overwhelmed, you can always run away and come back to them later, and these emergent challenges add another welcome layer of danger to the survival sandbox. And you’ll find plenty more optional bosses well-hidden in this massive world.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"ignvideo\\\" data-slug=\\\"zelda-breath-of-the-wild-3-new-minutes-of-gameplay\\\" data-loop=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003eOn the other hand, dungeon bosses are challenging face-offs you can’t run away from. They’re as big on spectacle as ever, and my favorite ones involve ingenious combat puzzles where you need to use your Shekiah Slate, a powerful tool given to you early on that gives you special abilities like magnetising metal objects or creating bombs, to weaken the boss before you can take it down.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"sub-header\\\" data-label=\\\"Puzzling Mementos\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003eThe Sheikah Slate is a major piece of the main quest, which puts Link on a journey to reclaim his memories of Princess Zelda after an apocalyptic event left Hyrule in ruins. It took me roughly 40 hours to slay the final boss and piece together what happened 100 years ago. While most Zelda games are rooted in heavy tradition, this coming-of-age story is anything but and has plenty of charming characters and surprises to reveal. It’s amazing that it works so well while letting you tackle its dungeons in any order you want.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"quoteBox\\\"\\u003eMy favorite quests involved piecing together a series of clues.\\u003c/section\\u003eHundreds of NPCs waiting to send you on side quests and puzzle shrines pepper the landscape, and there’s even more to discover hidden behind vague clues. The fetch-questy ones aren’t as interesting as the bonafide rabbit holes of The Witcher 3, but they still introduce you to interesting characters and dole out helpful info, meals, and materials. My favorite quests involved piecing together a series of clues: in one example, a wandering minstrel sang a mysterious song that dropped hints as to the location of a special shrine. Some don’t even show up as quests in your log, so you have to pay attention.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"ignvideo\\\" data-slug=\\\"the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-gameplay-compilation-trailer\\\" data-loop=\\\"\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003ePuzzle shrines yield their own useful rewards in the form of materials and handy weapon upgrades. These shrines involve short, inventive puzzle rooms which present you with a few clues and leave your to experiment in order to solve them. There’s a wide variety of them and a majority are excellent little puzzles to figure out, but a few of the combat-focused challenges are repeated and another handful use motion controls that just don’t feel quite as sharp enough due to wonky physics.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003e\\u003csection data-transform=\\\"quoteBox\\\"\\u003eMotion controls don't feel quite as sharp.\\u003c/section\\u003eStill, the techniques you learn from Shrines become essential training for Breath of the Wild’s fantastic dungeons. For the sake of avoiding spoilers I won’t go into too much detail, but these daunting, massive logic puzzles demand that you look at all the moving pieces in order to solve them. But every time I came across a new Shrine I was excited to uncover whatever new challenge it contained, with some Shrines in particular feeling as intricate as early levels in Portal, because they hinted at something much bigger and more impressive to come.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003eThere are even more cryptic challenges throughout Hyrule, some hidden behind riddles, and others are large mazes or other inventive ideas. Even after 50 hours, I still can’t believe I haven’t seen almost everything, but the surprises keep on coming. I estimate it would take over 100 hours to solve every side quest, puzzle, and collectible. It is a truly massive game to tackle.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003c/section\\u003e\"]},\"authorSocialDetails\":[{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":true,\"id\":\"Article:58b77fa8e4b080df1f252128.authorSocialDetails.0\",\"typename\":\"Author\"}],\"object\":{\"type\":\"id\",\"generated\":false,\"id\":\"Object:7b45c687-92d8-421b-a693-5703face2de2\",\"typename\":\"Object\"},\"__typename\":\"Article\",\"subHeadline\":\"An

watershed game that reinvents a 30-year-old franchise. It presents a wonderful sandbox full of mystery, dangling dozens upon dozens of tantalizing things in front of you that just beg to be explored. I’ve had so many adventures in Breath of the Wild, and each one has a unique story behind what led me to them, making them stories on top of stories. And even after I’ve spent more than 50 hours searching the far reaches of Hyrule, I still manage to come across things I haven’t seen before. I’ll easily spend 50 to 100 more trying to track down its fascinating
